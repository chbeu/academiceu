I had the honor to serve on her PhD committee.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Beyond asking challenging questions and Shabnam nicely defending her work, it was also a very special experience for me because it was the first time I attended the Dutch PhD defense which happens to be very different defenses I know (e.g., from Austria). There is a very (!) strict dress code. And already understanding the dress code regulations requires a PhD&amp;mdash;minimum! ;-)
Also, there is a strict protocol to follow concerning where to sit, where to walk, when to walk, and in which order, etc. BTW&amp;mdash;lots of walking involved. The senate room has four doors and we used three of those for entering and leaving and re-entering. Very confusing was also that the defense comes without a presentation of the thesis. Well, it comes with a brief &amp;ldquo;layperson presentation&amp;rdquo; for the general audience. But members of the PhD committee are considered experts and have read the thesis; so, the committee is not even present in the senate room while the candidate is presenting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All in all&amp;mdash;a very interesting experience.&lt;/p>
