&lt;p>I had the pleasure being on the committees for Yu Liang and Darius Afchar.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The title of Yu&amp;rsquo;s dissertation is &amp;lsquo;Supporting Personalized Music Exploration through a Genre Exploration Recommender&amp;rsquo;. The defense took place in the nice chapel at Jheronimus Academy of Data Science. It was also the first time I wore a &amp;rsquo;toga&amp;rsquo; at a Dutch defense. (And for those interested: We followed the procedures of Eindhoven University of Technology.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Darius&amp;rsquo; dissertation is entitled &amp;lsquo;Interpretable Music Recommender Systems&amp;rsquo;. The defense took place at Sorbonne UniversitÃ©. Of course, lots of Deezer people were around because the research was done with Deezer. I had the pleasure asking the most difficult questions of the day ðŸ˜†. Darius was still talking to me afterwards; so, it must have been okay. ðŸ˜‰&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Roger&amp;rsquo;s work has the title &amp;lsquo;Metric Optimization and Mainstream Bias Mitigation in Recommender Systems&amp;rsquo;. While I was not part of the committee and did not attend the defense, Roger gladly handed over one copy of his dissertation. He even did that personally after Yu&amp;rsquo;s defense.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All three have done great work. And also the book covers look cool!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Congratulations to the new doctors ðŸ¥³&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
