A single evaluation method or measure is not able to evaluate all relevant aspects in a complex setting where a multitude of stakeholders are involved. Employing a multi-method evaluation, where multiple evaluation methods or measures are combined and integrated, allows for getting a richer picture and prevents blind spots in the evaluation outcome.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Together with &lt;a href="https://evazangerle.at" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eva Zangerle&lt;/a>, I maintain a website on &lt;a href="https://multimethods.info" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multi-method evaluation&lt;/a> where we collect resources that help to apply multi-method evaluation in research and development. Naturally, this collection is meant to grow over time and we are happy to share your resources and discuss best practices.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
