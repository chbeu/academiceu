Our UMUAI paper on human diversity perceptions is available online. In our work, we investigate the correlation of different implementations of the intra-list similarity (ILS) measure with human perceptions in the domains of movie and recipe recommendation. The results indicate that the particularities of the ILS metric implementation matter. Hence, ILS can indeed be a good proxy for human diversity perceptions. However, it depends on the details how the metric is implemented in the specific case. Thus, before using a specific metric implementation, validating it for the targeted application/domain is needed.
