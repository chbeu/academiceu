I am happy to announce that we have several vacant positions (at PhD and Postdoc level) to work with us within the framework of the EXDIGIT Research College at the Paris-Lodron University of Salzburg.
EXDIGIT stands for "Excellence in Digital Sciences and Interdisciplinary Technologies". In this interdisciplinary endeavor, we put a particular emphasis on bridging the existing research areas and represented disciplines at the faculty. 

I am particularly seeking for candidates to work with me on topics related to **fairness of algorithmic decision-making** and **adaptation and personalization**---specifically in the **recommender systems** field. Interest in the researching these topics in the music or media sector is a particular asset.
I expect the ability and interest to employ both, **computational research approaches** (e.g., offline evaluation in recommender systems research, data analysis of large data sets) as well **experimental (user) studies** (e.g., controlled experiments in the lab or in online settings).

**The closing date for applications is 31 July 2023.**
