Great news for all who want to learn more about recommender systems: In 2023, there will be a [Recommender Systems Summer School](https://acmrecsys.github.io/rsss2023/) again. ([The last one was in 2019](https://acmrecsys.github.io/rsss2019/).) 

This year's summer school will take place in Copenhagen, 12--16 June 2023. It is organized by [Maria Maistro](https://di.ku.dk/english/staff/?pure=en/persons/641366) (University of Copenhagen, Denmark), [Toine Bogers](http://toinebogers.com/) (IT University Copenhagen, Denmark), and [Alan Said](https://www.alansaid.com) (University of Gothenburg, Sweden).

The speakers are not announced yet. But behind the scenes I could see that there will be a lot of great speakers. You don't want to miss this!

Attending the summer school is a great opportunity for Masters and PhD students in the field of recommender systems---and actually also for Postdocs. The summer school offers a unique chance to learn from leading experts in the field. Besides you will naturally grow your network as you'll spend an entire week with participants and speakers who are all interested in research on recommender systems. The program includes a mix of lectures, tutorials, and hands-on workshops that provide a comprehensive introduction to the latest techniques and research in recommender systems.

(Note, I copied some text from [Joeran Beel's announcement on the summer school](https://recommender-systems.com/news/2023/01/20/recsys-summer-school-2023/) as he hits the point so perfectly.)
