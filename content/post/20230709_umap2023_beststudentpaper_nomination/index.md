What a great acknowledgment. Our  [UMAP 2023](https://www.um.org/umap2023/) paper entitled "Amplifying artists' voices: item provider perspectives on influence and fairness of music streaming platforms" was nominated for a Best Student Paper Award.

Congratulations to Giuseppe Spillo and team (Cataldo Musto, Marco Polignano, Pasquale Lops, Marco de Gemmis, and Giovanni Semeraro) who won the Best Student Paper Award---well deserved!
