We received the Women in RecSys Journal Paper of the Year Award 2024 for our paper [Where are the values? A systematic literature review on news recommender systems](/publications/bauer-2024-values). Receiving this award two times in a row (2023 and 2024)---how cool is that?! :-)

It will be a pleasure presenting our work in the main program of RecSys 2024 in Bari.
