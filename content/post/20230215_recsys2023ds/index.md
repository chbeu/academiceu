The [Call for Papers](https://recsys.acm.org/recsys23/call/#content-tab-1-4-tab) for the Doctoral Symposium at [RecSys 2023](https://recsys.acm.org/recsys23/) in Singapore is online.

This year, I have the honor co-chairing the symposium with [Cataldo Musto](http://www.di.uniba.it/~swap/index.php?n=Membri.CataldoMusto) and [ Xiangnan He](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~hexn/).

We are looking forward to receiving lots of submissions. It is always a pleasure supporting young academic talent in their PhD journey.

Deadline is May 23rd, 2023.
