Inspired by the end-of-year reviews of [Michael Ekstrand](https://md.ekstrandom.net/blog/2023/12/2023) and [Matt Kelly](https://log.lab.matkelly.com/year-in-review-2023), I thought it might be a good idea to do that too.

It has been a pretty full year with many ups-- -yet, also downs.


## My personal highlights
- Starting as a full professor at PLUS, advocating interdisciplinary research as part of the EXDIGIT initiative.
- I had the honor of giving the [opening keynote address at ISMIR](/talks/kn05_ismir2023/). ISMIR was an amazing experience.
- Traveling a lot: From this year's home countries (Austria and The Netherlands), I traveled for work to Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Singapore, Switzerland, UK.
- Reviving the collaboration with [AndrÃ©s Ferraro](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WQglBowAAAAJ) on bias mitigation in music recommender systems. We are going strong ðŸ’ª


## Publications

## Advising and supervising PhD researchers
- I am happy that I keep serving as the co-promotor of [Marloes Vredenborg](https://marloesvredenborg.com) (UU).
- While not officially acting in a (co-)promotor role, I keep working with [Anouk van Kasteren](http://anoukvankasteren.com) (UU); this comes quite handy, as Marloes and Anouk are working on the same project.
- This year, I started collaborating with [Daniele Pretolesi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-vmPHIUAAAAJ) (AIT) as the secondary supervisor.

- We didn't win the bid to organize RecSys 2025.
- After moving back to Austria, I was not very active in playing music.
- It has taken me a while to find an apartment I liked in Salzburg.
- The many travels for work and the back-and-forth travel between Utrecht and Vienna in the beginning of the year and between Salzburg and Vienna later in the year got increasingly exhausting.

## Wrap up
Iâ€™m pretty sure Iâ€™ve forgotten a thing or two or three. Particularly some downsides (is it denial?!). 
I want to thank those who supported and encouraged me to move forward, hold my head up high, and uphold integrity.
