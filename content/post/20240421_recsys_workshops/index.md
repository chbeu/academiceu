This year, I am involved in the organization of two workshops at [RecSys 2024](https://recsys.acm.org/recsys24/).

I am happy to join [Andr√©s Ferraro](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WQglBowAAAAJ&hl=en), [Lorenzo Porcaro](https://lorenzoporcaro.me/), and [Peter Knees](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=MtyaO2cAAAAJ) for the 2nd edition of MuRS---the [Music Recommender Systems Workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/murs-2024).

With [Alan Said](https://www.alansaid.com) and [Eva Zangerle](https://evazangerle.at), I organize a workshop on [Reflections on Recommender Systems Past, Present, and Future (INTROSPECTIVES 2024](https://introspectives.github.io/2024/), which is the spiritual follow-up to our [PERSPECTIVES workshop series](https://perspectives-ws.github.io/).)

The Call for Papers will soon be available at the workshop websites.
