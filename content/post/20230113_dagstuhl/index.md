I am looking forward to spend next week at Schloss Dagstuhl. Together with [Ben Carterette](http://ir.cis.udel.edu/~carteret/), [Nicola Ferro](http://www.dei.unipd.it/~ferro/), and [Norbert Fuhr](http://www.is.inf.uni-due.de/staff/fuhr.html), I am co-organizer of the seminar on the [Frontiers of Information Access Experimentation for Research and Education](https://www.dagstuhl.de/23031).

It will be an intense but---for sure---also an enjoyable and productive week.
