Today, [Karlijn Dinnissen](https://karlijnd.github.io) had the first-year assessment of her PhD plan. As expected, she successfully passed this stage. The external reviewer, [Michael Ekstrand](https://md.ekstrandom.net), confirmed that she is well on track in her PhD journey. Congratulations to Karlijn! And thank you to Michael Ekstrand for serving as a reviewer.

Karlijn entitled her presentation "Improving Fairness and Transparency for Item Providers in Multi-Stakeholder Music Recommender Systems". The item providers are the artists---in case you wondered. :-)
