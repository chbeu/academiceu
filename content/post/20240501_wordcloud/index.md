I played around with [Scholar Goggler](https://scholargoggler.com/), which makes it easy creating a word cloud from your Google/Semantic Scholar profiles (and PubMed).

I think [Figure 2](#figure-wordcloud2) looks better, but [Figure 1](#figure-wordcloud1) is a bit more informative. Yet, overall, these are not telling a lot: I work on recommenders and evaluation---now you know ;-)
[Figure 3](#figure-wordcloud3) based on my Semantic Scholar profile puts the music domain more central. Yet, also the term "research". See, now it is official: I am doing research :D
