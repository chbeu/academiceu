I just returned from an intense and productive week at Dagstuhl [Dagstuhl seminar](https://www.dagstuhl.de/). 
Together with [Ben Carterette](http://ir.cis.udel.edu/~carteret/), [Nicola Ferro](http://www.dei.unipd.it/~ferro/), and [Norbert Fuhr](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=p53Ht7UAAAAJ), I co-organized the seminar on the [Frontiers of Information Access Experimentation for Research and Education](https://www.dagstuhl.de/23031).

It has been a great week. And I am very happy about the work we have accomplished and the inspiring discussions. I have learned a lot. The final report is indeed more or less done and only needs a bit of polishing before we can publish it. Thank you to all participants for your great contributions!

I am, of course, also very happy that we have invited the right people to also have fun in the music room ;-)
