I had the honor of participating in two panels at [Forum Kultur](https://forumkultur.at/), an event organized by the [Federal Ministry Republic of Austria for Arts, Culture, Civil Service and Sport (BMKOES)](https://www.bmkoes.gv.at/en.html). The thematic focus of this event was artificial intelligence.

The main panel of the event was moderated by Claudia Zettel. We discussed the risks and opportunities of AI for art and culture with Nina George, Paul Nemitz, Wolfgang Ullrich, and Marlies Wirth.

The second panel on AI in cultural organizations was organized in cooperation with the [Austrian Commission for UNESCO (Ã–UK)](https://www.unesco.at/en/about-us/austrian-commission-for-unesco). I enjoyed participating in the panel with Patrik Ager, S()fia Braga, and Alexander Dumreicher-Ivanceanu, moderated by Christine Maass.
