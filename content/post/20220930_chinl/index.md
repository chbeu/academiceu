This month [CHI Nederland](https://chinederland.nl/) features my [CHI 2022 LBW paper](/publications/ferwerda-2022-conformity-culture) (co-authored with [Bruce Ferwerda](https://www.bruceferwerda.com/)) about the conformity effect across cultures.  
https://chinederland.nl/2022/09/chi-nl-read-conformity-effect-across-cultures/

In our study design, participants had to create a group music playlist, where a song was only added if there was unanimous agreement to do so.

Let's hope that our findings will make it as an ingredient into group recommender systems. It could be a means to design the algorithms in a way so that most group members will accept the final outcome.
