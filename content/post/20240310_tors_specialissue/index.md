Habemus Special Issue :-)

Our Special Issue (together with [Alan Said](http://alansaid.com) and [Eva Zangerle](https://evazangerle.at)) on [Perspectives on Recommender Systems Evaluation](https://dl.acm.org/toc/tors/2024/2/1) is available in the ACM Digital Library.
The special issue consists of ten great papers providing different perspectives on recommender systems evaluation.

We thank all authors who submitted their work to this special issue and all reviewers who devoted a substantial amount of time and effort to providing constructive and insightful feedback to the authors.

By the way: Beyond giving brief introduction to the 10 papers in the special issue, our editorial also provides an overview/categorization of the papers' perspectives, contribution types, and their used datasets.


I am very happy that the collaboration with [Eva Zangerle](https://evazangerle.at) and  [Alan Said](http://alansaid.com) on the [PERSPECTIVES workshop series](http://perspectives-ws.github.io) led to this special issue. Thank you!   
Also, I am proud to we have contributed to the very first special issue of [ACM Transaction on Recommender Systems (TORS)](http://tors.acm.org) :-)
