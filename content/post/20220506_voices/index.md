Finally, the chapter that I co-authored with [Johanna Devaney](https://jcdevaney.tumblr.com) is online. In this chapter, we present how gender is constructed in audio. Based on literature on voice in music and in speech, we discuss how this construction influences our conception of gender identity.   

Our chapter is part of the book [Mediale Stimmentw√ºrfe---Perspectives of Media Voice Designs](https://www.grimme-institut.de/publikationen/schriftenreihe/p/d/mediale-stimmentwuerfe).
