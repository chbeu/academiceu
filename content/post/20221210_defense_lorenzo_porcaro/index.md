Next week, [Lorenzo Porcaro will defend his PhD thesis](https://t.co/6XLU8u0o9Y) with the title "Assessing the Impact of Music Recommendation Diversity on Listeners".

I have to honor to chair the jury consisting of two legends in the field, Perfecto Herrera (UPF) and Mounia Lalmas-Roelleke (Spotify),---and myself. At UPF, the chair is indeed called president. When else will I have the opportunity to be called "the president" ;-)
