Today, the new journal [ACM Transactions on Recommender Systems (TORS)](https://dl.acm.org/journal/tors) has launched its website and is ready to accept submissions. 
I am proud to be on the Editorial Board from the journal's very beginning. I will serve as an Associate Editor and I am looking forward to many submissions and new insights into the field of recommender systems.
