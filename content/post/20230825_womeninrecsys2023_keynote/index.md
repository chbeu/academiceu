I am looking forward to giving a keynote at the [Women in RecSys 2023 Keynote Series](https://recsys.acm.org/recsys23/women-in-recsys/#content-tab-1-2-tab) next Wednesday (30 August 2023). It will take place online (via Zoom) and everyone is welcome to attend.

Also watch out for the other keynotes that are yet to come on 6 and 13 September 2023.
