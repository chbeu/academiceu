I  had the pleasure of being a guest on the Austrian radio program [Mahlzeit Burgenland](https://burgenland.orf.at/magazin/stories/3275671/) (in German) to discuss some of my favorite topics: music, AI, and broadcasting.
I enjoyed the moderation by Georg Prenner. It was such an inspiring conversation---both on air as well as off air!

Also, as the talk show is called "Mahlzeit Burgenland", I got the chance to share one of my favorite recipes. Thus, my food recommendation of the day: Topfenfleckerl---a traditional Austrian dish that I highly recommend. The traditional recipe as passed on by my grandma is available online: [Topfenfleckerl](https://burgenland.orf.at/magazin/stories/3275671/)


For those who missed the live broadcast, the episode is available for [online listening and as a podcast](https://sound.orf.at/podcast/bgl/mahlzeit-burgenland---kochen--tratschen/christine-bauer-wissenschaftlerin-zu-gast-bei-georg-prenner) in the next 30 days.

A big thank you to the Mahlzeit Burgenland team for the invitation and a great conversation.
