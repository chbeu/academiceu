What a nice way to start a new year---with a publication. [Bruce Ferwerda](https://bruceferwerda.com) in on beautiful Maui ðŸŒº to present our joint HICSS 2023 paper on conformity behavior in group decision-making.

In our work, we explored whether and how the ingroup favoritism manifests differently in terms of conformity behavior depending on the 'flipping direction' (in favor or against an item). The results show that group inclusiveness does not play a role in the general tendency to conform. However, when it comes to a negative flipping direction (thus, deciding to conform with the group against an item), a higher feeling of group inclusiveness seems to play a role; yet, for individualist cultures only.
