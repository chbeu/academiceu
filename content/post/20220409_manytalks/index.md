I had a particularly busy week with talks. It started with a  [panel discussion at the Symposium Medienethik]({{< ref "/talks/pd07_fhsp2022_medienethik" >}}) in St. Pölten, Austria. I could indeed participate on-site, which felt great after a long time of online-only events. Then, I was invited for a [talk at MARL at the New York University]({{< ref "/talks/it18_marl2022" >}}), USA,---this time an online talk. It was great to connect across the continents. Due to the time zone differences, it was 10:00 pm at my place---a new experience to give such a ''late night talk''. And right the day after, I **virtually** travelled to Innsbruck, Austria, for an online [talk at the Lunchtime Seminar series at Universität Innsbruck]({{< ref "/talks/it19_uibk2022" >}}).   

It was a pleasure to give these talks. And I feel honored that I am in ''great demand''. Well, and now I enjoy a relaxing weekend. Rest is important, too :-)
