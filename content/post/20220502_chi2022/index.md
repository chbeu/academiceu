It is a pleasure to attend [CHI 2022](https://chi2022.acm.org) on-site. There are great talks---of course. Yet, meeting people and talk about research---and life, the universe and everything---that's equally important and equally interesting. 

Today, I was chairing a session [Trust, Recommendation, and Explanable AI (XAI)](https://programs.sigchi.org/chi/2022/program/session/73420) where we had five excellent talks. Further, I participated in the [Social Justice 1: Towards a Collective Manifesto](https://programs.sigchi.org/chi/2022/program/session/81226) session, where we started a collective manifesto to make room for solidarity across the CHI community. This session was organized by the Social Justice Co-Chairs, where we (the Allyship Co-Chairs) were happy to team up with. Tomorrow, we'll continue with the [Social Justice 2: The Intersection of Allyship and Social Justice](https://programs.sigchi.org/chi/2022/program/session/81227), where we open up room for expanding the notion of allyship.

On Wednesday, the Allyship Co-Chairs organize the [Allyship Fireside Chat](https://programs.sigchi.org/chi/2022/program/session/82030), where we will discuss what it means to be an ally and to create a supportive CHI community. We aim at generating discussion and suggestions on how to be a supportive community member.

Do you want to be an ally---a better ally? Please follow the [YouTube Allyship Crash Course](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9mxzhRFUHfPhngNeNLsrec4UBblJo_X_). We have also created a [Quiz module](https://bit.ly/38f8Eay) to accompany the [Crash Course](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9mxzhRFUHfPhngNeNLsrec4UBblJo_X_).
Have a look at this [CHI blog for a summary](https://chi2022.acm.org/2022/04/30/allyship-crash-course-quiz-and-fireside-chat/) of these activities.



The atmosphere in New Orleans is great, too. And I am looking forward to explore the city after the conference.
