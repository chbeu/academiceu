Together with  [Eva Zangerle](https://evazangerle.at) and [Alan Said](https://www.alansaid.com), I am Guest Editor of the first special issue of the new journal [ACM Transactions on Recommender Systems](https://dl.acm.org/journal/tors/):  'Perspectives on Recommender Systems Evaluation'. The [Call for Papers](TORS-CfP-SI-Evaluation.pdf) and the submission details are already available. The deadline is ***30 November 2022***.


Keep in mind, that  we also organize a workshop about this topic: [PERSPECTIVES 2022](https://perspectives-ws.github.io/2022/) (which will be collocated with [RecSys 2022](https://recsys.acm.org/recsys22/)).
