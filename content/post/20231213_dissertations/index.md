What a rich expansion to my library: 3 dissertations within a month!

I had the pleasure being on the committees for Yu Liang and Darius Afchar.

The title of Yu's dissertation is 'Supporting Personalized Music Exploration through a Genre Exploration Recommender'. The defense took place in the nice chapel at Jheronimus Academy of Data Science. It was also the first time I wore a 'toga' at a Dutch defense. (And for those interested: We followed the procedures of Eindhoven University of Technology.)

Darius' dissertation is entitled 'Interpretable Music Recommender Systems'. The defense took place at Sorbonne UniversitÃ©. Of course, lots of Deezer people were around because the research was done with Deezer. I had the pleasure asking the most difficult questions of the day ðŸ˜†. Darius was still talking to me afterwards; so, it must have been okay. ðŸ˜‰

Roger's work has the title 'Metric Optimization and Mainstream Bias Mitigation in Recommender Systems'. While I was not part of the committee and did not attend the defense, Roger gladly handed over one copy of his dissertation. He even did that personally after Yu's defense.

All three have done great work. And also the book covers look cool!

Congratulations to the new doctors ðŸ¥³
