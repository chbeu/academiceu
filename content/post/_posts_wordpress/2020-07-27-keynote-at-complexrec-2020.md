I am honored to announce that I am invited to give the keynote at the <a href="https://complexrec2020.aau.dk" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">4th Workshop on Recommendation in Complex Environments (ComplexRec 2020)</a>, co-located with <a href="https://recsys.acm.org/recsys20/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">RecSys 2020</a>. The **fancy** ;-) title of my talk is: _Ratings in, rankings out. Keep it simple, they said. But we need more than that._
