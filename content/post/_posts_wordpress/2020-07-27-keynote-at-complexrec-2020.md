I am honored to announce that I am invited to give the keynote at the [4th Workshop on Recommendation in Complex Environments (ComplexRec 2020)](https://complexrec2020.aau.dk), co-located with [RecSys 2020](https://recsys.acm.org/recsys20/). The **fancy** ;-) title of my talk is: _Ratings in, rankings out. Keep it simple, they said. But we need more than that_.
