You missed my talk at PrivacyWeek 2019? Just watch it now :-). It's 53 minutes long.



You can also download it from the [media.ccc.de archive](https://media.ccc.de/v/pw19-245-sag-mir-was-du-hrst-und-ich-sage-dir-wer-du-bist-). Optionally, you can choose the audio track ''English'', where you hear the simultaneous translation into English.
