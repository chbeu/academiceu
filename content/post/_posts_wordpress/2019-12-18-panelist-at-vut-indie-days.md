I am happy to announce that I will join one of the panels at [VUT Indie Days Köln](https://www.vut.de/vut-indie-days/aktuelles-indie-days/artikel/details/vut-indie-days-koeln/), taking place for the first time as part of the [c/o pop Convention 2020](https://c-o-pop.de/convention/). I am looking forward to this event already now.
