I proudly present the [PLOS ONE article](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0217389) by [Markus Schedl](https://www.mschedl.eu) and me: We analyze music preferences in 47 countries with respect to what is considered mainstream in a particular country. And, of course, we evaluate recommendation approaches considering users' mainstreaminess.
