Are you interested in attending my <a href="https://sigir.org/chiir2020/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CHIIR 2020</a> tutorial on multi-method evaluation (Leveraging multiple methods to answer what you were looking for)?

Consider preparing a small (very small!) task for the tutorial. It will help you get the best out of it for your very own research project. I summarized the task on the <a href="https://multimethods.info" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">multimethods.info</a> site that I maintain together with <a href="https://evazangerle.at" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Eva Zangerle</a> from Universit√§t Innsbruck: <a href="https://multimethods.info/?page_id=122" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Task description for the CHIIR 2020 Tutorial ''Leveraging multiple methods to answer what you were looking for''</a>
