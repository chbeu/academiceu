Are you interested in attending my [CHIIR 2020](https://sigir.org/chiir2020/) tutorial on multi-method evaluation (Leveraging multiple methods to answer what you were looking for)?

Consider preparing a small (very small!) task for the tutorial. It will help you get the best out of it for your very own research project. I summarized the task on the [multimethods.info](https://multimethods.info/) site that I maintain together with [Eva Zangerle](https://evazangerle.at) from Universit√§t Innsbruck: [Task description for the CHIIR 2020 Tutorial ''Leveraging multiple methods to answer what you were looking for''](https://multimethods.info/?page_id=122).
