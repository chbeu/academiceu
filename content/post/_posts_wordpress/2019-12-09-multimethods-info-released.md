In our joint effort, advocating for multi-method evaluation, <a href="https://www.evazangerle.at" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Eva Zangerle</a> and me have set up a dedicated website: <a href="https://multimethods.info" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://multimethods.info</a>. On that page, we collect resources that help to apply multi-method evaluation in research and development.
