Unfortunately, CHIIR 2020 was cancelled. This is really sad news. I was so much looking forward to holding the tutorial on multi-method evaluation. Meanwhile, you can have a look at https://multimethods.info, which I maintain with [Eva Zangerle](https://evazangerle.at). You can find a collection of useful material there.
