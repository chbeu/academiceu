I am proud to announce that the late breaking work paper on ''Cross-country user connections in an online social network for music'' that I co-authored with Markus Schedl has been accepted for CHI 2019.

I am looking forward to participate in this conferences. And with meeting a lot of great people there, I am sure that we will have a great time at CHI in Glasgow!
