<a href="https://andrebola.github.io/about/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Andr√©s Ferraro</a> will present our joint paper at CHIIR 2021. In the paper with the title Break the Loop: Gender Imbalance in Music Recommenders, we investigate the imbalance in music recommendations with respect to the artists gender. We propose a simple re-ranking approach to mitigate the problem and show in a simulation of feedback loops how the gender (im-)balances evolves over time.
