Being a mentor is inspiring. And it is an overwhelming experience to see a talent grow. So I did not hesitate to participate as a mentor also in the next round of [WiMIR mentoring](https://wimir.wordpress.com/2020/03/19/wimir-mentoring-round-2020/). I will mentor a great, talented female researcher.
