What an honor that my recent work with [Andr√©s Ferraro](https://andrebola.github.io) is featured as an example for research on Equality, Diversity & Inclusion at Utrecht University's website. There is also a sneak peek to an upcoming work with [Johanna Devaney](https://jcdevaney.tumblr.com).

Read the [article based the interview with me](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/equality-diversity-inclusion/music-recommenders-show-a-strong-gender-bias).
