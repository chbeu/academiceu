I am happy to announce that I will be guiding one of the nine virtual sessions of the <a href="https://wimir.wordpress.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WiMIR workshop 2020</a> at <a href="https://ismir.github.io/ISMIR2020/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">vISMIR2020</a>. The title of my session is: _The **best ever** recommendation & For who? And how do you know that?_

I am very much looking forward to it.

Registration information will be announced soon. Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/Women_MIR?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">@Women_MIR</a> to not miss any news.
