I am happy to announce that I will be guiding one of the nine virtual sessions of the [WiMIR workshop 2020](https://wimir.wordpress.com) at [ISMIR 2020](https://ismir.github.io/ISMIR2020/). The title of my session is: _The **best ever** recommendation & For who? And how do you know that?_

I am very much looking forward to it.
