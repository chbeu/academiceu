I am happy to announce that we &ndash; [Eva Zangerle](https://evazangerle.at), <a href="https://www.alansaid.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Alain Said</a>, and me &ndash; will co-organize the workshop Perspectives on the Evaluation of Recommender Systems (PERSPECTIVES) at <a href="https://recsys.acm.org/recsys21/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">RecSys 2021</a>. Finger crossed that the event can indeed happen in Amsterdam and that many of use can safely participate. There will definitely be the possibility to participate online.

More infos will follow soon. Stay tuned!
