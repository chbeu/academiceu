I am happy to announce that I will give a talk at the event <a href="https://ngi.ait.ac.at/event/ngi-talk-3-ai-and-beyond/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NGI Talk #3: AI and beyond</a> on ''How will AI change the way we perceive and interact with computers?''

Afterwards, I will join the panel discussion.

The event is organized by the <a href="https://www.ait.ac.at/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">AIT Austrian Institute of Technology</a>. It will take place at <a href="https://www.ocg.at/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">OCG</a> in Vienna, Austria, on 3 June 2019.
