I am happy to announce that I will give a talk at the event [NGI Talk #3: AI and beyond](https://ngi.ait.ac.at/event/ngi-talk-3-ai-and-beyond/) on ''How will AI change the way we perceive and interact with computers?''

Afterwards, I will join the panel discussion.

The event is organized by the [AIT Austrian Institute of Technology](https://www.ait.ac.at/). It will take place at [OCG](https://www.ocg.at/) in Vienna, Austria, on 3 June 2019.
