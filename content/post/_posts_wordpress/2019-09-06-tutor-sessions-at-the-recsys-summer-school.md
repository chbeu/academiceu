I am happy to announce that Martijn C. Willemsen and I organize [tutor sessions](https://acmrecsys.github.io/rsss2019/recsys_summerschool_tutorassignment.pdf) in scope of the [RecSys Summer School 2019](https://acmrecsys.github.io/rsss2019/). The idea is that each participant can discuss the specific research goals and questions with senior researchers/teachers of the summer school and fellow students.

Participation is highly recommended (especially for for PhD and MSc students), but optional. For more information, have a look at the [assignment](https://acmrecsys.github.io/rsss2019/recsys_summerschool_tutorassignment.pdf).

We kindly ask you to sign up via the following [Google form](https://forms.gle/caQeMZqHZVQs1k1B8) before Sunday, 8 September, 21h, as we will need some time to plan the sessions.
