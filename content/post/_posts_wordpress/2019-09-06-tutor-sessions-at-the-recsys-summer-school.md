I am happy to announce that Martijn C. Willemsen and I organize <a href="https://acmrecsys.github.io/rsss2019/recsys_summerschool_tutorassignment.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tutor sessions</a> in scope of the <a href="https://acmrecsys.github.io/rsss2019/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">RecSys Summer School 2019</a>. The idea is that each participant can discuss the specific research goals and questions with senior researchers/teachers of the summer school and fellow students.

Participation is highly recommended (especially for for PhD and MSc students), but optional. For more information, have a look at the <a href="https://acmrecsys.github.io/rsss2019/recsys_summerschool_tutorassignment.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">assignment</a>.

We kindly ask you to sign up via the following <a href="https://forms.gle/caQeMZqHZVQs1k1B8" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google form</a> before Sunday, 8 September, 21h, as we will need some time to plan the sessions.
