I am proud to announce that my position paper on ''The Potential of the Confluence of Theoretical and Algorithmic Modeling in Music Recommendation'' has been accepted for the ACM CHI 2019 Workshop on [Computational Modeling in Human-Computer Interaction (CompHCI 2019)](https://hcicompmodeling.wordpress.com).

The workshop is co-organized by Nikola Banovic, Antti Oulasvirta, and Per Ola Kristensson.

I am looking forward to participate in the workshop to discuss the developments in the field.
