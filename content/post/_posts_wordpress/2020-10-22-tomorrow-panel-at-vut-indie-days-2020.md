I am looking forward to join the panel on gender bias and discrimination in AI at the VUT Indie Days 2020 tomorrow. The panel is scheduled for 13:15 CEST and will be streamed on [c/o pop xoxo](https://c-o-pop.de/en/xoxo) in channel 1. Although originally planned to be held in English, the discussion will be in German. Maybe a good reason to brush up your German skills ;-)
