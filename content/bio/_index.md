Christine Bauer is EXDIGIT Professor of Interactive Intelligent Systems at the Department of Artificial Intelligence and Human Interfaces (AIHI) at the Paris Lodron University Salzburg, Austria.

<!--Her research vision is to leverage intelligent systems and embed them into socio-technical ecosystems to benefit humans and society. -->
Her research activities center on interactive intelligent systems, where she integrates research on intelligent technologies, the interaction of humans with intelligent systems, and heir interplay. Thereby, she takes a human-centered computing approach, where technology follows humans’ and society’s needs. Central themes in her research are context and context-adaptivity. In recent years, she worked on context-aware recommender systems in the music and media domains. Core interests in her research activities are fairness and multi-method evaluations. 
<!--Further interests span various fields such as online self-disclosure and privacy, methods for designing context-adaptive systems, and the creative industries, particularly the music sector.-->

Her multidisciplinary background drives her research and teaching activities. She holds a Doctoral degree in Social and Economic Sciences (Business Informatics) (2009, with honors) and a Diploma (equivalent to a Master) degree in International Business Administration (2002), both from the University of Vienna, Austria. Furthermore, she holds a Master degree (MSc) in Business Informatics (2011) from TU Wien, Austria. Further studies at the University of Wales Swansea (now: Swansea University), United Kingdom, the Konservatorium der Stadt Wien (now: MUK---Music and Arts University of the City of Vienna), Austria, and WU Vienna (Vienna University of Economics and Business), Austria.

Assistant Professor at the Department of Information and Computing Sciences at Utrecht University, The Netherlands (2020--2023). Senior Postdoc Researcher (Elise Richter laureate) at the Institute of Computational Perception at Johannes Kepler University Linz, Austria (2017--2020). Postdoctoral Researcher at the Department of Information Systems and Information Management at the University of Cologne, Germany (2015--2016). 2013 and 2015 Visiting Fellow at the School of Computer Science, Human-Computer Interaction Institute, Ubicomp Lab, at Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA. Assistant Professor at the Department of Information Systems and Operations at WU Vienna (Vienna University of Economics and Business), Austria (2009--2015).
Furthermore, she engaged in applied research as a Researcher at the E-Commerce Competence Center (EC3), Austria (2007--2009), and Junior Key Researcher at Fachhochschulstudiengänge Burgenland (University of Applied Sciences), Austria (2006--2007). Furthermore, she did freelance research, for instance, for the Research Studios Austria and the University of Vienna, Austria.
Before starting her academic career, she worked as Manager Licensing New Media at Austria’s biggest collecting society AKM (Autoren, Komponisten, Musikverleger), Austria (2002--2006).

She is an experienced teacher in a broad spectrum of topics in computing and information systems, taught across 17 institutions in six countries: Paris Lodron University Salzburg, Austria (since 2023); FH Salzburg, Austria (since 2023); Utrecht University, The Netherlands (2020--2023); University of Innsbruck, Austria (2019--2020); University of Vienna, Austria (2008--2018); Danube University Krems, Austria (2015--2017); University of Applied Sciences Technikum Wien, Austria (2016--2017); WU Vienna (Vienna University of Economics and Business), Vienna, Austria (2009--2015); Ferdinand Porsche FernFH Studiengänge (University of Applied Sciences with distance learning), Vienna, Austria (2009--2015).
