Christine Bauer is an assistant professor at the Human-Centered Computing group at the Department of Information and Computing Sciences at Utrecht University, The Netherlands.

<!--Her research vision is to leverage intelligent systems and embed them into socio-technical ecosystems to benefit humans and society. -->
Her research activities center on interactive intelligent systems, where she integrates research on intelligent technologies, the interaction of humans with intelligent systems, and heir interplay. Thereby, she takes a human-centered computing approach, where technology follows humans’ and society’s needs. Central themes in her research are context and context-adaptivity. In recent years, she worked on context-aware recommender systems in the music and media domains. Core interests in her research activities are fairness and multi-method evaluations. Further interests span various fields such as online self-disclosure and privacy, methods for designing context-adaptive systems, and the creative industries, particularly the music sector.

Her interdisciplinary background drives her research and teaching activities. She holds a Doctoral degree in Social and Economic Sciences (Business Informatics) (2009, with honors) and a Diploma (equivalent to a Master) degree in International Business Administration (2002), both from the University of Vienna, Austria. Furthermore, she holds a Master degree (MSc) in Business Informatics (2011) from TU Wien, Austria. Further studies at the University of Wales Swansea (now: Swansea University), United Kingdom, the Konservatorium der Stadt Wien (now: Music and Arts University of the City of Vienna), Austria, and WU Vienna (Vienna University of Economics and Business), Austria.

Senior Postdoc Researcher (Elise Richter laureate) at the Institute of Computational Perception at Johannes Kepler University Linz, Austria. Postdoctoral Researcher at the Department of Information Systems and Information Management at the University of Cologne (2015--2016). 2013 and 2015 Visiting Fellow at the School of Computer Science, Human-Computer Interaction Institute, Ubicomp Lab, at Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA. Assistant Professor at the Department of Information Systems and Operations at WU Vienna (Vienna University of Economics and Business), Austria (2009--2015).
Furthermore, she engaged in applied research as a Researcher at the E-Commerce Competence Center (EC3), Austria (2007--2009), and Junior Key Researcher at Fachhochschulstudiengänge Burgenland (University of Applied Sciences), Austria (2006--2007). Furthermore, she did freelance research, for instance, for the Research Studios Austria and the University of Vienna, Austria.
Before starting her academic career, she worked as Manager Licensing New Media at Austria’s biggest collecting society AKM (Autoren, Komponisten, Musikverleger), Austria (2002--2006).

She is an experienced teacher in a broad spectrum of topics in computing and information systems, taught across 15 institutions in six countries. Utrecht University, The Netherlands (since 2020); Universität Innsbruck, Austria (2019--2020); University of Vienna, Austria (2008--2018); Danube University Krems, Austria (2015--2017); University of Applied Sciences Technikum Wien, Austria (2016--2017); WU Vienna (Vienna University of Economics and Business), Vienna, Austria (2009--2015); Ferdinand Porsche FernFH Studiengänge (University of Applied Sciences with distance learning), Vienna, Austria (2009--2015). Guest Lecturer at Jönköping University, Sweden (2020--2021) and the Popakademie Baden-Württemberg (University for Music Business, Creative Industries and Popular Music), Mannheim, Germany (2012--2015). She was an eTutor at the Department of Electronic Business at the University of Vienna, Austria (2007--2008) and a Tutor at the Business Informatics Group at TU Wien, Austria (2008--2009).

She is on the Editorial Board of ACM Transactions on Recommender Systems (TORS). She has co-organized the workshop series Perspectives on the Evaluation of Recommender Systems (PERSPECTIVES) at RecSys 2021--2023, and the Workshop on Intelligent User-Adapted Interfaces: Design and Multi-Modal Evaluation (IUadaptMe 2019) at UMAP 2019. She co-organized the 2023 Dagstuhl Seminar Frontiers of Information Access Experimentation for Research and Education. At the ACM Summer School on Recommender Systems 2019 and 2023, she held interactive sessions on Multi-Method Evaluation of Recommender Systems. At UMAP 2021, she gave a tutorial on Multi-Method Evaluation of Adaptive Systems. Furthermore, she was a co-chair of the Doctoral Symposium at RecSys 2021; she is currently serving in the same role at RecSys 2023 and the PhD Symposium at CIKM 2023. Additionally, she engages in initiatives such as Women in Music Information Retrieval (WiMIR) and the Elise Richter Network. At CHI 2022 and 2023, she served as an Allyship Co-Chair. Moreover, she is repeatedly invited as a speaker or panelist at scientific and non-scientific events.

She has co-authored more than 110 publications. Three of them were awarded as best research papers, one received an award of excellence (highly commended paper), and four had additional nominations for best paper awards. She is a laureate of the prestigious Elise Richter grant for the project “Fine-grained Culture-aware Music Recommender Systems” (2017--2020), an excellence program sponsored by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF). She holds five awards as a best reviewer or outstanding reviewer (UMAP 2019 and 2022, RecSys 2018, 2019, and 2022). Further, Special Recognition for Outstanding Review at RecSys 2022 (for 3 reviews), IUI 2022, CHI 2020, and RecSys 2020.
