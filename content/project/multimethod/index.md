title: "Multi-method evaluation"
summary: "The comprehensive evaluation of the performance of a  system is a complex endeavor: many facets need to be considered in configuring an adequate and effective evaluation setting. 
A single evaluation method or measure is not able to evaluate all relevant aspects in a complex setting where a multitude of stakeholders are involved. Employing a multi-method evaluation, where multiple evaluation methods or measures are combined and integrated, allows for getting a richer picture and prevents blind spots in the evaluation outcome."

The comprehensive evaluation of the performance of a  system is a complex endeavor: many facets need to be considered in configuring an adequate and effective evaluation setting. 
A single evaluation method or measure is not able to evaluate all relevant aspects in a complex setting where a multitude of stakeholders are involved. Employing a multi-method evaluation, where multiple evaluation methods or measures are combined and integrated, allows for getting a richer picture and prevents blind spots in the evaluation outcome.

Together with [Eva Zangerle](https://evazangerle.at), I maintain a website on [multi-method evaluation](https://multimethods.info) where we collect resources that help to apply multi-method evaluation in research and development. Naturally, this collection is meant to grow over time and we are happy to share your resources and discuss best practices.
