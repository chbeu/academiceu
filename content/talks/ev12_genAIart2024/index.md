summary: "W&K Forum Symposium 2024: Harmony & Dissonance: Generative AI in Music and the Arts."
abstract: "Explore the dynamic relationship between generative AI and music within the broader spectrum of the arts. This interdisciplinary symposium will focus on the opportunities that generative AI presents to artists, while also addressing the inherent fears and challenges that accompany this technological innovation. We will explore the diverse ways of artistic collaboration with AI for musical expression or improving efficiency of specific tasks. This exploration will not shy away from acknowledging the concerns and uncertainties that loom over the artistic community and the music and arts sectors."
