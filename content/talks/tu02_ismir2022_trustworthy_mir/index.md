summary: Tutorial on Trustworthy Music Information Retrieval at ISMIR 2022.

abstract: "The MIR community shows an increasing interest in understanding how current technologies affect the everyday experience of people all over the world, e.g., how we listen to music, compose songs, or learn to play an instrument. As it was introduced in the FAT-MIR tutorial held at ISMIR 2019, a great discussion has aroused around the ethical, social, economic, legal, and cultural implications that the use of MIR systems have in our life.


In this tutorial, we aim at building upon and expanding the aforementioned debate, discussing the more recent results obtained by the MIR community and beyond. The goal of the tutorial is to show how values, such as fairness and diversity, can be embedded in the life cycle of MIR systems to make them trustworthy: from algorithmic design to evaluation practices and regulatory proposals. To achieve that, we will discuss examples of, among the others, popularity bias, gender bias, algorithmic bias, music styles underrepresentation, and diversity-related phenomena (e.g. filter bubbles).


This tutorial is suitable for researchers and students in MIR working in any domain, as these issues are relevant for all MIR tasks. The examples will mostly focus on music information retrieval and recommendation, but there are no prerequisites for taking this tutorial. Besides presenting recent research insights, the tutorial will integrate two hands-on sessions, where we will involve the participants in reflecting on the design of evaluation methods that take into account values for which MIR systems should be accountable."
