abstract: 'We present a browsing interface that allows for an audiovisual exploration of regional music taste around the world. We exploit a total of 10,758,121 geolocated tweets about music. The web-based geo-aware visualization and auralization called Tastalyzer enables exploring and analyzing music taste on a fine-grained geographical level, such as (i) comparing rural and corresponding urban music taste within an agglomeration (city) or (ii) comparing the music taste in a target region (agglomeration) to the taste of the country the region is part of and (iii) to the global music taste.'
