abstract: '‘Digital out-of-home advertising’ (DOOHA) leverages digital screens to reach out to consumers at any time and anywhere in public space. While personalization---tailoring advertisements to an individual---has proven successful for advertising, this concept has its limitations. Particularly challenging are privacy concerns and negative perceptions caused by personalized advertisements. We propose situationalization---adapting advertisements based on the current situation---as a promising (additional) option. The suggested PERSIT matrix (PERsonalizationSITuationalization) structures the available adaptation strategies. It helps advertisers and system designers to make educated strategy decisions for adaptive DOOHA system designs.'
