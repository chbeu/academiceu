abstract: "This volume of CEUR-WS proceedings includes papers of the 2nd Music Recommender Systems Workshop (MuRS 2024). The workshop is co-located with the 18th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (RecSys 2024) in Bari, Italy.
The goal of the MuRS workshop series is to bridge the existing gap between the diverse research communities focused on challenges specific to music recommender systems. The workshop provides a space for researchers and practitioners from multiple disciplines, from both academia and industry, to exchange perspectives and to promote discussion on future research directions in the area of music
recommender systems.
We received twelve paper submissions. Each paper submission received two reviews. We selected six papers for publication in this volume which will be presented during the workshop. Furthermore, we received two submissions of previously published papers, which we accepted for being presented at the workshop; one of these is included in these proceedings as an abstract.
We would like to thank the members of the program committee for their valuable reviews and suggestions. We also thank the authors for their submissions and contributions to the workshop."
