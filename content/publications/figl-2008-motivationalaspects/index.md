abstract: "This paper presents a quantitative study on students' motivation in technology-enhanced courses. Four technology-enhanced courses with differing course designs were investigated concerning their impacts on student's motivation. Results show that, although the designs vary only in some didactical elements, the course designs differ significantly concerning students' motivation and the motives that drive commitment and performance. The paper discusses several motivational, didactical elements and further results regarding their implications for course designs."
