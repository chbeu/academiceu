abstract: "Web 2.0 and social media have triggered radical changes in the very fundament of music business. In times before the Internet era, the music business was characterized by a standardized process including the creation, selection, distribution, and consumption of music. The roles of the involved market players were clear-cut. Yet, in the early days of music business, the market was a highly concentrated market. However, with the evolution of Web 2.0 and its new possibilities for home recording available at relatively low-cost and easy to handle, a myriad of music items have been released on the Web. The main consequences of that development are the following: (1) the overall amount of music items available increased drastically, as there are now tens of millions of music items available at a consumer's fingertip; and (2) the ratio between (professional) high-quality music and low-quality music shifted towards an overall deterioration. This, in turn, has an impact on every market player involved in the music business."
