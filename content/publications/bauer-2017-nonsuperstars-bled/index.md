abstract: 'Music Recommender Systems (MRS) are important drivers in music industry and are widely adopted by music platforms. Other than most MRS research exploring MRS from a technical or from a consumers’ perspective, this work focuses on the impact, value generation, challenges and opportunities for those, who contribute the core value, i.e. the artists. We outline the non-superstar artist’s perspective on MRS, and explore the question if and how non-superstar artists may benefit from MRS to foster their professional advancement. Thereby, we explain several techniques how MRS generate recommendations and discuss their impact on non-superstar artists.'
