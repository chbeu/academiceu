abstract: 'Crowdsourcing is a recently developed method that relies on various alternatives of collaboration to solve problems efficiently. Crowdsourcing is a recent development to solve a variety of problems efficiently, and which implies various alternatives of collaboration. However, as novel technologies are able to exploit location-sensing capabilities of mobile devices, location-based crowdsourcing (LBCS) developed as a new concept. This paper suggests a typology for LBCS as a means for fostering collaboration with the crowd through three types of LBCS: confirmation-based, digital good-based, and physical-based. Each type is underpinned with exemplary applications. Furthermore, opportunities and challenges are analysed; and future trends in LBCS are discussed.'
