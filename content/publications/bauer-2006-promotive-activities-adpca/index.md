abstract: 'This paper aims to transfer central, influential concepts and ideas from person-centered education into the context of technology-enhanced learning. We systematically review promotive activities and humanistic educational concepts and share our experiences in introducing and actually living these activities and interpersonal attitudes in technology- enhanced environments. Students’ reactions confirm the validity of our approach, which proposes to complement personal resourcefulness with Web-supported activities. Our primary goal is to make learning in today’s knowledge society a growthful experience for learners as well as facilitators.'
