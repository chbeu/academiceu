abstract: "As users are increasingly confronted with information and choice overload, we need the 'right' information, at the 'right' time, in the 'right' place, in the 'right' way, to the `â€™right' person. Information retrieval and recommender systems are effective means to address this goal. When optimizing and evaluating such systems, we often disregard that a 'typical' user is not the only stakeholder interested in a well-functioning system. Beyond ignoring the needs of specific stakeholders, this eventually leads to a malfunctioning system for anyone. In this talk, I will demonstrate that we need to consider the demands of the various stakeholders and provide insights into how we can embrace those needs when evaluating our systems."
