abstract: 'Digital signage is an economically promising field in advertising. Yet, it is a hardly researched field; first empirical attempts focused on consumer reactions. Digital signage, though, brings together various market players, all of which with different objectives and expected benefits. For this reason, we introduce a conceptual framework for interactive digital signage that allows developing various business strategies and associated business values integrating the entire set of possible players in their relevant roles and configuration requirements. A rule set represents one of the core modules of the framework, which allows for a sustainable integration of functionalities. Acknowledging that technological and non- technological advancements of digital signage need reconcilement, our proposed integrated approach to digital signage allows for interdisciplinary contributions.'
