abstract: 'In this paper we provide a record of relevant factors for the reasonable selection of learning settings. Our work aims to help teachers, instructors, facilitators, etc. in creating a convenient blend of learning settings for their specific and unique hybrid learning environments. Research is in progress, for which this paperâ€™s work forms the basis in order to create a matrix framework for systematically balancing learning environments.'
