abstract: 'Digital signage is a rapidly emerging marketing channel that promises to reach out to consumers at any time and any place. Still, it is a rather novel research field. First empirical studies focused on consumer behavior. At the backend, though, digital signage brings together various market players, all of which with their very own business objectives and expected benefits, where some of which may complement one another and some might be conflicting. In order to tap the full potential of digital signage, the entire range of market players need to be provided with appropriate backend services. In emerging, technology-driven applications such as digital signage there is a vital need for a universally valid, flexible, structuring framework that provides the basis for target-oriented research using a shared conceptualization. In fact, such a framework is essential to enable, yield and foster sustainability in a novel and interdisciplinary research field like digital signage. For this reason, we introduce a cohesive and flexible conceptual framework for contextual digital signage that integrates the entire set of possible market players in their relevant roles, application location categories, strategies and contextualization types of a contextual digital signage system.'
