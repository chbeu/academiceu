abstract: 'Evaluation is a central step when it comes to developing, optimizing, and deploying rec- ommender systems. The PERSPECTIVES 2021 workshop at the 15th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems brought together academia and industry to critically reflect on the evaluation of recommender systems.
