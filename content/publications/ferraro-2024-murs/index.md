abstract: 'Music recommendation has been relevant to the Recommender Systems (RecSys) community since the early days. With the growth of music streaming platforms, algorithmic recommendations have become critical in the music industry. However, many challenges are still wide open in the area of music recommender systems. Such challenges are currently being addressed in several research communities, including and beyond the RecSys and the Music Information Retrieval (MIR) communities. 
The RecSys conference has traditionally not focused very much on music content understanding. In contrast, while music content understanding is central to the MIR community, research on recommender systems is not prominent in MIR research.
The Music Recommender Systems Workshop (MuRS) aims at bridging the existing gap between the diverse research communities focused on the specific challenges of music recommender systems. The workshop provides a space for researchers and practitioners from multiple disciplines to jointly discuss and exchange perspectives and solutions, and to promote discussion from both academia and industry upon future research directions in the area of music recommender systems.'
