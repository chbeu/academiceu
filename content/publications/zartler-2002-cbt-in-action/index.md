abstract: 'Technology acceptance is a heavily discussed field – nowadays, especially in the context of multimedia products. This paper is about the evaluation of the Hyperbook Privatrecht – a CBT that contains the basics of Austrian Civil Law. After the first use at the University of Applied Sciences Vienna, its acceptance was evaluated. Both product-based factors and general acceptance factors, were analysed considering various parameters of acceptance research.
The results show that the Hyperbook Privatrecht is generally accepted by the students.
The CBT had a supporting function within their personal learning processes. Additionally, some of the general acceptance factors had an impact in this case. The results of this evaluation encourage the further integration of CBTs within teaching.'
