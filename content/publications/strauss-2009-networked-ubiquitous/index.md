abstract: 'This paper focuses on identifying and analyzing a potential innovative application for the insurance industry through the use of networked ubiquitous computing environment. In particular, it will describe damage prevention as an exemplary application of ubiquitous computing in the insurance sector. With respect to such an implementation for damage prevention, this paper presents a framework for decision support, considering cost drivers, indicators, parameters, and other influencing factors.'
