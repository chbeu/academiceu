abstract: "Human-Computer Interaction research is traditionally collaborative. However, the current authorship model – i.e., placing authors’ names in a particular order – makes the contributions of collaborators who are not the “first author” (or not mentioned) less visible which negatively affects career paths. Still, if smaller and larger contributions are equally rewarded with a “good” position in the author list, a researcher’s achievements may be overrated. We suggest a solution with interactive technology to highlight contributions. The benefits include high visibility of contributions, in-situ access to in-depth researcher profiles, in situ access to similar work by the contributors, and low incentive for artificial credits."
