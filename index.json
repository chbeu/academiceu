Therefore, it is essential to consider all stakeholders' goals and values when developing and evaluating the music recommender systems integrated into these services. One vital goal is treating artists fairly, thereby giving them a fair chance to have their music recommended and listened to, and subsequently building a fan base. Such artist fairness is often assumed to have a trade-off with user goals such as satisfaction. Using insights from two studies, this work shows the opposite: some goals from different stakeholders are complementary. Our first study, in which we interview music artists, demonstrates that they often see increased transparency and control for users as a means to also improve artist fairness. We expand with a second study asking other music industry professionals about these topics using a questionnaire. Its results indicate that transparency towards users is highly valued and should be increased.","tags":["music","recommender systems","control","transparency","artists","interviews","music industry professionals","item provider","user"],"title":"How control and transparency for users could improve artist fairness in music recommender systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["news"],"content":"The survey paper on the evaluation of recommender systems with Eva Zangerle and Alan Said was accepted for publication in ACM Transaction on Recommender Systems (TORS).

In this paper, we present an overview of research specifically focused on the evaluation of recommender systems. We perform a systematic literature review, in which we analyze 57 papers spanning six years (2017--2022). Focusing on the processes surrounding evaluation, we dial in on the methods applied, the datasets utilized, and the metrics used. Our study shows that the predominant experiment type in research on the evaluation of recommender systems is offline experimentation and that online evaluations are primarily used in combination with other experimentation methods, e.g., an offline experiment. Furthermore, we find that only a few datasets (MovieLens, Amazon review dataset) are widely used, while many datasets are used in only a few papers each. We observe a similar scenario when analyzing the employed performance metrics---a few metrics are widely used (precision, nDCG, and Recall), while many others are used in only a few papers. Overall, our review indicates that beyond-accuracy qualities are rarely assessed. Our analysis shows that the research community working on evaluation has focused on the development of evaluation in a rather narrow scope, with the majority of experiments focusing on a few metrics, datasets, and methods.","tags":["recommender systems","evaluation","systematic literature review","survey","TORS"],"title":"Exploring the landscape of recommender systems evaluation: practices and perspectives","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["news"],"content":"\nEva Zangerle and me received the Women in RecSys Journal Paper of the Year Award 2023 for our paper Evaluating Recommender Systems: Survey and Framework—yay!\nIt was both an honor and a a pleasure presenting our work in the main program of RecSys 2023 in Singapore.

They, too, are (in)directly affected by music streaming services. Therefore, this work explores the perspective of music industry professionals. We present a study that addresses the role of streaming services and recommender systems in their jobs. Results indicate this role is significant. Furthermore, participants feel that music recommender systems lack transparency and are insufficiently controllable, for both customers and artists.

Hence, bias mitigation approaches are needed to counteract those. In the music sector, gender imbalance is a particular topical subject. Earlier work has shown that the gender imbalance in the sector translates to the output of music recommender systems. Several works emphasize that items representing women should be given more exposure in music recommendations. In this work, we present an exploratory analysis of several bias mitigation strategies. Using a simulation approach, we explore the effects of different pre- and post-processing strategies for bias mitigation. We provide an in-depth analysis using state-of-the-art performance measures and metrics concerning gender fairness. The results indicate that the different strategies can help to mitigate gender bias in the long term in particular ways: Some strategies' render improvement in exposure of women in the top ranks; other approaches help recommending more variety of items representing women.","tags":["recommender systems","fairness","gender bias","bias","gender","simulation"],"title":"Strategies for mitigating artist gender bias in music recommendation: a simulation study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christine Bauer","Ben Carterette","Norbert Fuhr","Nicola Ferro","Guglielmo Faggioli"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1694995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1694995200,"objectID":"980aaf4d3b1ee17c6a1e61b2f40bbecb","permalink":"https://christinebauer.eu/publications/bauer-2023-dagstuhl/","publishdate":"2023-05-03T01:13:46.973627Z","relpermalink":"/publications/bauer-2023-dagstuhl/","section":"publications","summary":"This report documents the program and the outcomes of Dagstuhl Seminar 23031 'Frontiers of Information Access Experimentation for Research and Education', which brought together 37 participants from 12 countries.

The seminar brought together experts from various sub-fields of information access, namely IR, RS, NLP, information science, and human-computer interaction to create a joint understanding of the problems and challenges presented by next generation information access systems, from both the research and the experimentation point of views, to discuss existing solutions and impediments, and to propose next steps to be pursued in the area in order to improve not also our research methods and findings but also the education of the new generation of researchers and developers. The seminar featured a series of long and short talks delivered by participants, who helped in setting a common ground and in letting emerge topics of interest to be explored as the main output of the seminar.

Whichever artists, albums, or songs are exposed to consumers on these platforms therefore greatly influences what music is ultimately consumed. As a result, the impact of these platforms on artists---their main item providers---is considerable. The recommender systems at the core of streaming platforms, though, have traditionally been developed focusing on end consumer objectives. Only recently, researchers have started to include item provider objectives, though rarely through reaching out to item providers directly. By omitting this important stakeholder’s point of view, we risk not understanding what artists value most, and might miss first-hand ideas on how to improve streaming platforms and recommender systems. Therefore, we conducted semi-structured interviews to capture the artists’ view. Specifically, we explore artists’ considerations regarding fairness, transparency, and diversity in music recommender systems, and the role artists envision for streaming platforms regarding those topics. We identify some topics with a clear consensus among artists, such as desiring more control over which music is recommended to whom, and expecting streaming platforms to actively increase music diversity in recommendations. In contrast, artists’ opinions differ on whether platforms should actively intervene in recommender systems to, e.g., increase localization or gender balance. Further, we observe that artists often take user preferences into account and even suggest new platform functionality to benefit both users and item providers. We encourage utilizing these insights when designing and evaluating music streaming platforms and recommender systems.","tags":["music","recommender systems","fairness","artists","interviews","item provider"],"title":"Amplifying artists' voices: item provider perspectives on influence and fairness of music streaming platforms","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["news"],"content":"I am happy to announce that we have several vacant positions (at PhD and Postdoc level) to work with us within the framework of the EXDIGIT Research College at the Paris-Lodron University of Salzburg.

The idea behind *FairRecKit* is to facilitate the in-depth analysis of recommendation outcomes considering fairness aspects. With (nested) filters on user or item attributes, metrics can easily be compared across user and item subgroups. Further, (nested) filters can also be used on dataset level; this way, recommendation outcomes can be compared across several sub-datasets to analyze for differences considering fairness aspects. The software currently features 5 datasets, 11 metrics, and 21 recommendation algorithms to be used in computational experimentation. It is open source and developed in a modular manner to facilitate extension. The analysis software consists of two components: A software package (*FairRecKitLib*) that is used to run recommendation algorithms on the available datasets and a web-based user interface (*FairRecKitApp*) to start experiments, retrieve results of previous experiments, and analyze details. The application also comes with an extensive documentation and options for result customization, which makes for a flexible tool that supports in-depth analysis.","tags":["FairRecKit","resource","toolkit","analysis software","web-based","evaluation","analysis","recommender systems","music","movies"],"title":"FairRecKit: A Web-based analysis software for recommender evaluations","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["news"],"content":"The Call for Papers for the Doctoral Symposium at RecSys 2023 in Singapore is online.\nThis year, I have the honor co-chairing the symposium with Cataldo Musto and Xiangnan He.\nWe are looking forward to receiving lots of submissions.

In offline experiments, diversity is commonly assessed with the help of the intra-list similarity (ILS) measure, which is defined as the average pairwise similarity of the items in a list. The similarity of each pair of items is often determined based on domain-specific meta-data, e.g., movie genres. While this approach is common in the literature, it in most cases remains open if a particular implementation of the ILS measure is actually a valid proxy for the human diversity perception in a given application. With this work, we address this research gap and investigate the correlation of different ILS implementations with human perceptions in the domains of movie and recipe recommendation. We conducted several user studies involving over 500 participants. Our results indicate that the particularities of the ILS metric implementation matter. While we found that the ILS metric can be a good proxy for human perceptions, it turns out that it is important to individually validate the used ILS metric implementation for a given application. On a more general level, our work points to a certain level of oversimplification in recommender systems research when it comes to the design of computational proxies for human quality perceptions and thus calls for more research regarding the validation of the corresponding metrics.","tags":["recommender systems","diversity","diversity perception","intra-list similarity","user study"],"title":"Intra-list similarity and human diversity perceptions of recommendations: the details matter","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["news"],"content":"It was a great pleasure to welcome Sven Müller (CEO at AutLay) in my master course on Adaptive Interactive Systems.

Such facets include, for instance, defining the specific goals of the evaluation, choosing an evaluation method, underlying data, and suitable evaluation metrics. In this paper, we consolidate and systematically organize this dispersed knowledge on recommender systems evaluation. We introduce the “Framework for EValuating Recommender systems” (FEVR) that we derive from the discourse on recommender systems evaluation. In FEVR, we categorize the evaluation space of recommender systems evaluation. We postulate that the comprehensive evaluation of a recommender system frequently requires considering multiple facets and perspectives in the evaluation. The FEVR framework provides a structured foundation to adopt adequate evaluation configurations that encompass this required multi-facettedness and provides the basis to advance in the field. We outline and discuss the challenges of a comprehensive evaluation of recommender systems, and provide an outlook on what we need to embrace and do to move forward as a research community.","tags":["evaluation","recommender systems","FEVR","survey","multimethod","framework"],"title":"Evaluating recommender systems: survey and framework","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["news"],"content":"I am happy to share that episode #8 of the Recsperts podcast was released.

As fairness is a fundamental value of human life, there is increasing pressure for these algorithmic decision-making processes to be fair as well. However, many factors make recommender systems prone to biases, resulting in unfair outcomes. Furthermore, several stakeholders are involved, who may all have distinct needs requiring different fairness considerations. While there is an increasing interest in research on recommender system fairness in general, the music domain has received relatively little attention. This mini review, therefore, outlines current literature on music recommender system fairness from the perspective of each relevant stakeholder and the stakeholders combined. For instance, various works address gender fairness: one line of research compares differences in recommendation quality across user gender groups, and another line focuses on the imbalanced representation of artist gender in the recommendations. In addition to gender, popularity bias is frequently addressed; yet, primarily from the user perspective and rarely addressing how it impacts the representation of artists. Overall, this narrative literature review shows that the large majority of works analyze the current situation of fairness in music recommender systems, whereas only a few works propose approaches to improve it. This is, thus, a promising direction for future research.","tags":["music","recommender systems","fairness","review","multi-stakeholder"],"title":"Fairness in music recommender systems: a stakeholder-centered mini review","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["news"],"content":"\nWhat an honor—I have received a Best Reviewer Award at UMAP 2022.\nGreat to see so many engaged reviewers in the community.

This phenomenon has been widely observed to exist especially against an objectively correct answer---in face-to-face and online interaction alike. To a lesser extent, studies have investigated the conformity effect in settings based on personal opinions and feelings; thus, in settings where an objectively right or wrong answer does not exist. In such settings, the direction of conformity tends to play a role in whether an individual will conform. While cultural differences in conformity behavior have been observed repeatedly in settings with an objectively correct answer, the role of culture has not been explored yet for settings with subjective topics. Hence, the focus of this study is on how conformity develops across cultures for such cases. We developed an online experiment in which participants needed to reach a positive group consensus on adding a song to a music playlist. After seeing the group members’ ratings, the participants had the opportunity to revise their own. Our findings suggest that the willingness to flip to a positive outcome was far less than to a negative outcome. Overall, conformity behavior was far less pronounced for participants from the United Kingdom compared to participants from India.","tags":["conformity","music","group decision-making","flipping direction","culture"],"title":"To flip or not to flip: conformity effect across cultures","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["news"],"content":"Together with Eva Zangerle and Alan Said, I am Guest Editor of the first special issue of the new journal ACM Transactions on Recommender Systems: ‘Perspectives on Recommender Systems Evaluation’.

Building on existing work on gender in singing, we explore the ways in which the voice is gendered through the use of voice production software. Specifically, we look at Auto-Tune, which allows for a recorded natural voice to be manipulated, and Vocaloid, which allows for the computational generation of new singing voices. We also examine parallels in speech in terms of interactive artificial intelligence voice assistants. This speech technology parallels the aforementioned music technologies in that the voice may be either manipulated recordings of natural voice or computational generations. Our analysis aims to look beyond gender binaries and to consider the intersectional identities of the voices in the fields of music and speech. This analysis of the curation of voices in music and speech contributes to our understanding of the aural construction of gender in society. Abstract: In diesem Artikel untersuchen wir die explizite Vergeschlechtlichung in der Art und Weise, wie Stimmen im Kontext von Musik und Audio behandelt werden, und analysieren, inwiefern dies mit der speziellen Funktion der Stimme in einem gegebenen Kontext zusammenhängt. Aufbauend auf bestehenden Arbeiten zu Gender in der Singstimme untersuchen wir, wie die Stimme durch den Einsatz von Software zur Stimmproduktion („Voice Production Software“) genderspezifisch geprägt wird. Insbesondere betrachten wir Auto-Tune, das die Bearbeitung einer aufgenommenen echten Stimme erlaubt, und Vocaloid, das es ermöglicht, computergestützt eine neue Singstimme zu erzeugen. Des Weiteren untersuchen wir Parallelen zur Sprachtechnologie bei interaktiven Sprachassistenten mit künstlicher Intelligenz. Diese Sprachtechnologie weist insofern Parallelen zu den oben genannten Musiktechnologien auf, als es sich auch hier entweder um bearbeitete Aufnahmen einer natürlichen Stimme handelt oder um eine computergestützt neu erzeugte Stimme. Unsere Analyse zielt darauf ab, über die binäre Betrachtung von Gender hinauszugehen und die intersektionalen Identitäten von Stimmen in den Bereichen Musik und Sprache zu berücksichtigen. Diese Analyse der Kuratierung von Stimmen in Musik und Sprache trägt zum Verständnis der klanglichen Konstruktion von Gender in unserer Gesellschaft bei.","tags":["voices","gender"],"title":"Constructing gender in audio: exploring how the curation of the voice in music and speech influences our conception of gender identity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christine Bauer","Verena Krawarik","Michael Litschka","Anna Michalski","Florian Saurwein"],"categories":null,"content":" Press release (in German)\n","date":1648731600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1648731600,"objectID":"05ed439264c835c6bb9e9976fb52bc8b","permalink":"https://christinebauer.eu/talks/pd07_fhsp2022_medienethik/","publishdate":"2022-03-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talks/pd07_fhsp2022_medienethik/","section":"talks","summary":"Panelist on the topic 'KI und Algorithmen als ethische Herausforderungen für eine mediatisierte Gesellschaft' at the Symposium Medienethik at FH St. Pölten.","tags":["panel","FH St. Pölten","media","artificial intelligence","ethics","algorithms"],"title":"KI und Algorithmen als ethische Herausforderungen für eine mediatisierte Gesellschaft","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1646751600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646751600,"objectID":"0404779465c0b720d03c8ffa2e387306","permalink":"https://christinebauer.eu/talks/kt01_codarts/","publishdate":"2022-02-28T22:16:51+01:00","relpermalink":"/talks/kt01_codarts/","section":"talks","summary":"Keynote at Codarts Rotterdam---International Women's Day 2022.","tags":["talk","keynote","international women's day","music","artists","gender bias","fairness"],"title":"Keynote: Celebrating an engaged music community and breaking the bias","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":["news"],"content":"Today, the new journal ACM Transactions on Recommender Systems (TORS) has launched its website and is ready to accept submissions.

There is an increasing interest to ensure that those platforms and systems are fair. Yet, we first need to understand what fairness means in such a context. Although artists are the main content providers for music platforms, there is a research gap concerning the artists' perspective. To fill this gap, we conducted interviews with music artists to understand how they are affected by current platforms and what improvements they deem necessary. Using a Qualitative Content Analysis, we identify the aspects that the artists consider relevant for fair platforms. In this paper, we discuss the following aspects derived from the interviews: fragmented presentation, reaching an audience, transparency, influencing users' listening behavior, popularity bias, artists' repertoire size, quotas for local music, gender balance, and new music.

Read the original article.\nMusic recommendation algorithms are unfair to female artists, but we can change that. Algorithms help lots of people discover new music.\nImage\u0026gt; by Omar Medina Films from Pixabay Article written by: Christine Bauer, Utrecht University and Andrés Ferraro, Universitat Pompeu Fabra\nThese days, more and more people listen to music on streaming apps – in early 2020, 400 million people were subscribed to one. These platforms use algorithms to recommend music based on listening habits. The recommended songs might feature in new playlists or they might start to play automatically when another playlist has ended.\nBut what the algorithms recommend is not always fair. In a new study we showed a widely used recommendation algorithm is more likely to pick music by male than female artists. In response, we’ve come up with a simple way to give more exposure to female artists.\nThe representation of women and gender minorities in the music industry is tremendously low. About 23% of artists in the 2019 Billboard 100 were women or gender minorities. Women represent 20% or less of registered composers and songwriters, while 98% of works performed by major orchestras are by male composers.\nThis bias is also present in streaming services. A few female “superstars” dominate among the most popular artists, but most female and mixed-gender artists are in the lower levels of popularity. While the problem stems from beyond the music industry, online music platforms and their algorithms that recommend music – called recommenders – play a large role.\nRead more:\nMusic streaming: listening to playlists drives down the revenue of smaller artists\nOur study While previous studies have repeatedly asked consumers for their opinion, the music artists, those providing the content, are rarely in the loop.\nWe wanted to put the spotlight on artists. We asked musicians to give us their views on what would make online music platforms more fair. When they said gender imbalance was a major problem, we decided to study this in more detail.\nOur analysis of around 330,000 users’ listening behaviour over nine years showed a clear picture – only 25% of the artists ever listened to were female. When we tested the algorithm we found, on average, the first recommended track was by a man, along with the next six. Users had to wait until song seven or eight to hear one by a woman.\nApplications like Spotify use algorithms to find recommendations.\nImage\u0026gt; by Štěpán Vraný from Pixabay Breaking the loop As users listen to the recommended songs, the algorithm learns from these. This creates a feedback loop.\nTo break this feedback loop, we came up with a simple approach to gradually give more exposure to female artists. We took the recommendations computed by the basic algorithm and re-ranked them – moving male artists a specified number of positions downwards.\nIn a simulation, we studied how our re-ranked recommendations could affect users’ listening behaviour in the longer term. With the help of our re-ranked algorithm, users would start changing their behaviour. They would listen to more female artists than before.\nEventually, the recommender started to learn from this change in behaviour. It began to place females higher up in the recommended list, even before our re-ranking. In other words, we broke the feedback loop.\nThis shows how easy it can be. Our simple method can help address the biases in the algorithms that play a large role in the way many people discover new music and artists. Next, we hope to study how real consumers perceive the changes introduced by the re-ranking strategy and how it impacts their listening behaviour in the long term.\nAnother crucial step would be to collect and use data about the wide scale of gender identities. We’re aware this binary gender classification does not reflect the multitude of gender identities. The unavailability of data beyond the gender binary is a massive obstacle, both for research as well as for taking action and making progress on a societal level.\nSo far, our simulation could demonstrate the benefits of a simple re-ranking approach. But responsibility is, of course, not with the platform providers alone. Initiatives such as Keychange and Women in Music are working to represent the underrepresented in the music industry. The rest of us need to follow.\nAs music festivals are being criticised for the lack of women in their lineups, any step towards representing more women all genders in a more balanced manner is a step in the right direction.\nChristine Bauer, Assistant Professor of Human Centred Computing, Utrecht University and Andrés Ferraro, PhD Candidate, Information and Communication Technologies, Universitat Pompeu Fabra\nAndrés Ferraro, Xavier Serra, Christine Bauer (2021).

Previous work has already identified several country-specific differences in the popularity distribution of music artists listened to. In particular, what constitutes the ''music mainstream'' strongly varies between countries. To complement and extend these results, the article at hand delivers the following major contributions: First, using state-of-the-art unsupervized learning techniques, we identify and thoroughly investigate (1) country profiles of music preferences on the fine-grained level of music tracks (in contrast to earlier work that relied on music preferences on the artist level) and (2) country archetypes that subsume countries sharing similar patterns of listening preferences. Second, we formulate four user models that leverage the user's country information on music preferences. Among others, we propose a user modeling approach to describe a music listener as a vector of similarities over the identified country clusters or archetypes. Third, we propose a context-aware music recommendation system that leverages implicit user feedback, where context is defined via the four user models. More precisely, it is a multi-layer generative model based on a variational autoencoder, in which contextual features can influence recommendations through a gating mechanism. Fourth, we thoroughly evaluate the proposed recommendation system and user models on a real-world corpus of more than one billion listening records of users around the world (out of which we use 369 million in our experiments) and show its merits vis-a-vis state-of-the-art algorithms that do not exploit this type of context information.","tags":[],"title":"Listener modeling and context-aware music recommendation based on country archetypes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dominik Kowald","Peter Müllner","Eva Zangerle","Christine Bauer","Markus Schedl","Elisabeth Lex"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628385071,"objectID":"b3167ba5249e5750009f34d8a6f106d7","permalink":"https://christinebauer.eu/publications/kowald-2021-support/","publishdate":"2021-08-08T01:13:46.410221Z","relpermalink":"/publications/kowald-2021-support/","section":"publications","summary":"Music recommender systems have become an integral part of music streaming services such as Spotify and Last.fm to assist users navigating the extensive music collections offered by them. However, while music listeners interested in mainstream music are traditionally served well by music recommender systems, users interested in music beyond the mainstream (i.e., non-popular music) rarely receive relevant recommendations. In this paper, we study the characteristics of beyond-mainstream music and music listeners and analyze to what extent these characteristics impact the quality of music recommendations provided. Therefore, we create a novel dataset consisting of Last.fm listening histories of several thousand beyond-mainstream music listeners, which we enrich with additional metadata describing music tracks and music listeners. Our analysis of this dataset shows four subgroups within the group of beyond-mainstream music listeners that differ not only with respect to their preferred music but also with their demographic characteristics. Furthermore, we evaluate the quality of music recommendations that these subgroups are provided with four different recommendation algorithms where we find significant differences between the groups. Specifically, our results show a positive correlation between a subgroup's openness towards music listened to by members of other subgroups and recommendation accuracy. We believe that our findings provide valuable insights for developing improved user models and recommendation approaches to better serve beyond-mainstream music listeners.","tags":[],"title":"Support the underground: characteristics of beyond-mainstream music listeners","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["news"],"content":"I had the honor being a guest at the Austrian radio program ‘‘Mahlzeit Burgenland’’.

Typically, we have users’ (explicit or implicit) ratings as input and rankings of items as output. Complex enough, yet too simplistic to reflect reality and indeed meet the various demands in practice.\n\nWe have learned that “context matters”. But what does it mean? What is the context that matters? And how do we get the relevant signals?  It is more than what we currently ascribe to and reflect in what we call “context-aware recommender systems”. Let’s have a view to related fields that deal with context as deeply complex input.\n\nAnd on the output side, we have individual items and also item bundles, complementaries, sequences, repeated recommendations, etc. What do we actually want to present? And how? For who? And why? A ranked list as output may seem like an appropriate one-size-fits-all solution, does it?\n\nIn this talk, I will reflect on the complexity of our research field, reach out to related fields such as context-aware computing and pervasive advertising for inspiration, and I will raise a lot of questions that have yet to be answered.","tags":["keynote","ComplexRec","RecSys","recommender systems","context"],"title":"Ratings in, rankings out.

In contrast to existing literature that investigates conformity to a majority opinion against an objectively correct answer, the originality of our study lies in that we investigate conformity in a subjective context. The emphasis of our analysis lies on the “switching direction” in favor or against an item. In an online experiment, groups of five had to create a music playlist. A song was added to the playlist with an unanimous posi- tive decision only. After seeing the other group members’ ratings, participants had the opportunity to revise their own response. Results suggest different behavior for originally favored compared to disliked songs. For favored songs, one negative judgement by another group member was sufficient to induce participants to downvote the song. For disliked songs, in contrast, a majority of positive judgements was needed to induce participants to switch their vote.","tags":["conformity","music","group decision-making","flipping direction"],"title":"Conformity behavior in group playlist creation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["news"],"content":"While CHIIR 2020 had to be cancelled due to the current global situation with Covid-19, the paper accompanying the tutorial on multi-method evaluation (that I would have held there) is published.\nChristine Bauer (2020).

On the one hand, many research endeavors focus on system-centric evaluation from an algorithmic perspective and consider the context of use only to a minor extent. On the other hand, there are research endeavors focusing on user-centric approaches to the design and evaluation of systems. However, algorithmic quality and perceived quality of user experience do not necessarily match. Thus, it is essential for system evaluation to substantially integrate multiple evaluation methods that cover a variety of relevant aspects and perspectives. Only such an integrated combination of methods may lead to a deep understanding of users, their behavior, and experience in their interaction with a system. This half-day tutorial follows the objective to raise awareness in the CHIIR community concerning the significance of using multiple methods in the evaluation of information retrieval and recommender systems. The tutorial illustrates the ''blind spots'' when using single methods. It introduces the concept of ''multi-method evaluation'' and discusses its benefits and challenges. While multi-method evaluations may be designed very flexibly, the tutorial presents broadly-defined basic options of how multiple methods may be integrated in an evaluation design. In group work, participants are encouraged to select and fine-tune a specific design that best matches their research endeavor's purpose.","tags":["evaluation","CHIIR","tutorial","multimethod"],"title":"Multi-method evaluation: leveraging multiple methods to answer what you were looking for","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["news"],"content":"Unfortunately, CHIIR 2020 was cancelled.

However, in the recommender systems research community, we have fallen prey to a McNamara fallacy to a worrying extent: In the majority of our research efforts, we rely almost exclusively on computational measures such as prediction accuracy, which are easier to make than applying other evaluation methods. However, it remains unclear whether small improvements in terms of such computational measures matter greatly and whether they lead us to better systems in practice. A paradigm shift in terms of our research culture and goals is therefore needed. We can no longer focus exclusively on abstract computational measures but must direct our attention to research questions that are more relevant and have more impact in the real world. In this work, we review the various ways of how recommender systems may create value; how they, positively or negatively, impact consumers, businesses, and the society; and how we can measure the resulting effects. Through our analyses, we identify a number of research gaps and propose ways of broadening and improving our methodology in a way that leads us to more impactful research in our field.","tags":[],"title":"Escaping the McNamara Fallacy: toward more impactful recommender systems research","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christine Bauer"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628385072,"objectID":"7b00ea8a6a6e0e27a1031c047fb3b1ac","permalink":"https://christinebauer.eu/publications/bauer-2020-helpartists/","publishdate":"2021-08-08T01:13:47.272438Z","relpermalink":"/publications/bauer-2020-helpartists/","section":"publications","summary":"The 21st edition of the Annual Conference of the International Society for Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR) introduced so-called “special sessions,” giving room for discussion on various topics related to music information retrieval (MIR).

While the major problem may lie deep in our society, music information retrieval contributes to promoting diversity or may create unequal opportunities for artists. For example, considering the known problem of popularity bias in music recommendation, it is important to investigate whether the short head of popular music artists and the long tail of less popular ones show similar patterns of diversity---in terms of, for example, age, gender, or ethnic origin---or the popularity bias amplifies a positive or negative effect. I advocate for reasonable opportunities for artists---for (currently) popular artists and artists in the long-tail alike---in music recommender systems. In this work, I represent the position that we need to develop a deep understanding of the biases and inequalities because it is the essential basis to design approaches for music recommendation that provide reasonable opportunities. Thus, research needs to investigate the various reasons that hinder equal opportunity and diversity in music recommendation.","tags":["equal opportunities","recommender systems","music recommender systems","music","artists","position paper"],"title":"Allowing for equal opportunities for artists in music recommendation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["news"],"content":"See my PrivacyWeek talk on Sag mir, was du hörst—und ich sage dir, wer du bist at Relive until it will be archived on the Media Site of the Chaos Computer Club Germany.\n","date":1572214894,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572214894,"objectID":"78ae38413c792f633056857640417b61","permalink":"https://christinebauer.eu/post/_posts_wordpress/2019-10-27-watch-my-privacyweek-talk-at-relive/","publishdate":"2019-10-27T22:21:34Z","relpermalink":"/post/_posts_wordpress/2019-10-27-watch-my-privacyweek-talk-at-relive/","section":"post","summary":"See my PrivacyWeek talk on Sag mir, was du hörst—und ich sage dir, wer du bist at Relive until it will be archived on the Media Site of the Chaos Computer Club Germany.","tags":["communication to the public","music","online self-disclosure","privacy","talk","privacyweek","video"],"title":"Watch my PrivacyWeek talk at Relive","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"\nSketch of my talk at @PrivacyWeek #pw19\nI love ❤️ this sketch.

For instance, people tend to select friends with similar music preferences. Furthermore, preferences and friending are influenced by cultural aspects. Recommender systems may benefit from these phenomena by using knowledge about the nature of social ties to better tailor recommendations to an individual. Focusing on the specifities of music preferences, we study user connections on Last.fm---an online social network for music. We identify those countries whose users are mainly connected within the same country, and those countries that are characterized by cross-country user connections. Strong cross-country connection pairs are typically characterized by similar cultural, historic, or linguistic backgrounds, or geographic proximity. The United States, the United Kingdom, and Russia are identified as countries having a large relative amount of user connections from other countries. Our results contribute to understanding the complexity of social ties and how they are reflected in connection behavior, and are a promising source for advancements of personalized systems.","tags":[],"title":"Cross-country user connections in an online social network for music","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christine Bauer"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1556668800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628385074,"objectID":"91f00138335f731ffb34970657544fc3","permalink":"https://christinebauer.eu/publications/bauer-2019-confluence-modeling/","publishdate":"2021-08-08T01:13:48.555038Z","relpermalink":"/publications/bauer-2019-confluence-modeling/","section":"publications","summary":"The task of a music recommender system is to predict what music item a particular user would like to listen to next. This position paper discusses the main challenges of the music preference prediction task: the lack of information on the many contextual factors influencing a user’s music preferences in existing open datasets, the lack of clarity of what the right choice of music is and whether a right choice exists at all; the multitude of criteria (beyond accuracy) that have to be met for a “good” music item recommendation; and the need for explanations on relationships to identify (and potentially counteract) unwanted biases in recommendation approaches.

We study three highly different social media platforms, Facebook, Last.fm, and 500px, and approach two main research questions: First, we set out to answer which countries’ social media users are mainly connected with users within their own country; and which countries are characterized by a wide spectrum of cross-country (transnational) user connections. In doing so, we also identify the “attractor” countries, being characterized by alluring a large portion of users from other countries to connect to users in the respective attractor country. Second, we compare the results between the three social media platforms under investigation and analyze and discuss differences in the cross-country connection patterns. Third, we investigate whether countries’ attractor values are correlated with cultural features (according to Hofstede). Our results contribute to understanding the complex social ties between people and how they are reflected in connection behavior on social media.","tags":[],"title":"A cross-country investigation of user connection patterns in online social networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christine Bauer","Markus Schedl"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656033073,"objectID":"e5b9df27f22eb53b10dacbcdecfac249","permalink":"https://christinebauer.eu/publications/bauer-2019-plosone-mainstreaminess/","publishdate":"2021-08-08T01:13:47.99559Z","relpermalink":"/publications/bauer-2019-plosone-mainstreaminess/","section":"publications","summary":"RELEVANCE: Popularity-based approaches are widely adopted in music recommendation systems, both in industry and research. These approaches recommend to the target user what is currently popular among all users of the system. However, as the popularity distribution of music items typically is a long-tail distribution, popularity-based approaches to music recommendation fall short in satisfying listeners that have specialized music preferences far away from the global music mainstream. Addressing this gap, the contribution of this article is three-fold.\n\nDEFINITION OF MAINSTREAMINESS MEASURES: First, we provide several quantitative measures describing the proximity of a user's music preference to the music mainstream. Assuming that there is a difference between the global music mainstream and a country-specific one, we define the measures at two levels: relating a listener's music preferences to the global music preferences of all users, or relating them to music preferences of the user's country. To quantify such music preferences, we define a music item's popularity in terms of artist playcounts (APC) and artist listener counts (ALC). Moreover, we adopt a distribution-based and a rank-based approach as means to decrease bias towards the head of the long-tail distribution. This eventually results in a framework of 6 measures to quantify music mainstream.\n\nDIFFERENCES BETWEEN COUNTRIES WITH RESPECT TO MUSIC MAINSTREAM: Second, we perform in-depth quantitative and qualitative studies of music mainstream in that we (i) analyze differences between countries in terms of their level of mainstreaminess, (ii) uncover both positive and negative outliers (substantially higher and lower country-specific popularity, respectively, compared to the global mainstream), analyzing these with a mixed-methods approach, and (iii) investigate differences between countries in terms of listening preferences related to popular music artists. We conduct our studies and experiments using the standardized LFM-1b dataset, from which we analyze about 800,000,000 listening events shared by about 53,000 users (from 47 countries) of the music streaming platform Last.fm. We show that there are substantial country-specific differences in listeners' music consumption behavior with respect to the most popular artists listened to.\n\nRATING PREDICTION EXPERIMENTS: Third, we demonstrate the applicability of our study results to improve music recommendation systems. To this end, we conduct rating prediction experiments in which we tailor recommendations to a user's level of preference for the music mainstream using the proposed 6 mainstreaminess measures: defined by a distribution-based or rank-based approach, defined on a global level or on a country level (for the user's country), and for APC or ALC. Our approach roughly equals a hybrid recommendation approach in which a demographic filtering strategy is implemented before collaborative filtering is performed. Results suggest that, in terms of rating prediction accuracy, each of the presented mainstreaminess definitions has its merits.","tags":["music","recommender systems","mainstreaminess","country"],"title":"Global and country-specific mainstreaminess measures: Definitions, analysis, and usage for improving personalized music recommendation systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1543190400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1543190400,"objectID":"916b8d1a2a3fe3cee18c84f58cc6f617","permalink":"https://christinebauer.eu/talks/t07_rotaryclub2018/","publishdate":"2021-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talks/t07_rotaryclub2018/","section":"talks","summary":"Talk at Rotary Club Linz-Altstadt.","tags":["talk","music","recommender systems"],"title":"Den richtigen Inhalt für den richtigen User im richtigen Moment: Musikempfehlungssysteme jetzt und in der Zukunft","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":["news"],"content":"I like interdisciplinary work.

Using the LFM-1b dataset of listening events of Last.fm users, we are able to uncover country-dependent differences in consumption of mainstream music as well as in user behavior with respect to social ties and users’ centrality. We could identify that users inclined to mainstream music tend to have stronger connections than the group of less mainstreamy users. Furthermore, our analysis revealed that users typically have less connections within a country than cross-country ones, with the first being stronger social ties, though. Results will help building better user models of listeners and in turn improve personalized music retrieval and recommendation algorithms.","tags":[],"title":"Investigating cross-country relationship between users' social ties and music mainstreaminess","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["news"],"content":"Yesterday’s IUadaptME workshop at UMAP 2018 was a great success!

Based on the LFM-1b dataset (including 53,258 users from 47 countries), we show that there are significant country-specific differences in listeners' music consumption behavior with respect to the most popular artists listened to. Results indicate that, for instance, Finnish users' listening behavior is farther away from the global mainstream, while United States' listeners are close to the global mainstream. Relying on rating prediction experiments, we tailor recommendations to a user's level of preference for mainstream (defined on a global level and on a country level) and the user's country. Results suggest that, in terms of rating prediction accuracy, a combination of these two filtering strategies works particularly well for users of countries far away from the global mainstream.","tags":[],"title":"Information imbalance and responsibility in recommender systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The comprehensive evaluation of the performance of a system is a complex endeavor: many facets need to be considered in configuring an adequate and effective evaluation setting.

In online settings, many consumers disclose PI abundantly - this is particularly true for information provided on social network services. Still, people manage the privacy level they want to maintain by disclosing by disclosing PI accordingly. In addition, studies have shown that consumers’ online self-disclosure (OSD) differs across cultures. Therefore, intelligent systems should consider cultural issues when collecting, processing, storing or protecting data from consumers. However, existing studies typically rely on a comparison of two cultures, providing valuable insights but not drawing a comprehensive picture. We introduce an open research model for cultural OSD research, based on the privacy calculus theory. Our open research model incorporates six cultural dimensions, six predictors, and 24 structured propositions. It represents a comprehensive approach that provides a basis to explain possible cultural OSD phenomena in a systematic way.","tags":[],"title":"An open model for researching the role of culture in online self-disclosure","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christine Bauer"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628385075,"objectID":"03ddc5a11af4591d8dd240061bf48291","permalink":"https://christinebauer.eu/publications/bauer-2018-musikwirtschaftsforschung-informatik/","publishdate":"2021-08-08T01:13:49.937832Z","relpermalink":"/publications/bauer-2018-musikwirtschaftsforschung-informatik/","section":"publications","summary":"This article takes the computer science perspective on music business research.

While these technological capabilities have attracted considerable research attention in informatics, studies exploring their application and impact are scarce. Marketing, and especially retailing, represents an applied science that might benefit from DS. In support of this assumption, some studies demonstrate that the presence of DS showing emotional content creates favorable shopping experiences and positively influences consumer behavior. However, so far, little is known about what could be achieved with DS including its technological capabilities at the point of sale. Thus, this paper offers a short review of extant findings related to DS in retailing. Subsequently, we elaborate on two retailing-orientated functionalities for retailing and develop two specific research questions.","tags":[],"title":"Research directions for digital signage systems in retail","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alaaeddine Yousfi","Marcin Hewelt","Christine Bauer","Mathias Weske"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628385074,"objectID":"71e7ec127228b7b6a788fecab2d8dc98","permalink":"https://christinebauer.eu/publications/yousfi-2018-ubpmn-2/","publishdate":"2021-08-08T01:13:48.692463Z","relpermalink":"/publications/yousfi-2018-ubpmn-2/","section":"publications","summary":"Ubiquitous business processes are the new generation of processes that pervade the physical space and interact with their environments using a minimum of human involvement. Although they are now widely deployed in the industry, their deployment is still ad hoc. They are implemented after an arbitrary modeling phase or no modeling phase at all. The absence of a solid modeling phase backing up the implementation generates many loopholes that are stressed in the literature. Here, we tackle the issue of modeling ubiquitous business processes. We propose patterns to represent the recent ubiquitous computing features. These patterns are the outcome of an analysis we conducted in the field of human-computer interaction to examine how the features are actually deployed. The patterns’ understandability, ease-of-use, usefulness and completeness are examined via a user experiment. The results indicate that these four indexes are on the positive track. Hence, the patterns may be the backbone of ubiquitous business process modeling in industrial applications.","tags":[],"title":"Towards uBPMN-based patterns for modeling ubiquitous business processes","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["news"],"content":"The paper entitled ‘‘An Open Model for Researching the Role of Culture in Online Self-Disclosure’’ that I co-authored with Katharina Sophie Schmid and Christine Strauss is nominated for the Best Paper Award at HICSS 2018.

However, formal definitions to quantify the level of mainstreaminess of a listener are rare and those available define mainstreaminess based on fractions between some kind of individual and global listening profiles. We argue, in contrast, that measures based on a modified version of the well-established Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence as well as rank-order correlation coefficient may be better suited to capture the mainstreaminess of listeners. We therefore propose two measures adopting KL divergence and rank-order correlation and show, on a real-world dataset of over one billion user-generated listening events (LFM-1b), that music recommender systems can notably benefit when grouping users according to their level of mainstreaminess with respect to these two measures.

This position paper considers that the perception of surprise and/or opposition may be purposely prepared when several recommendations are provided (e.g., in terms of a music playlist) or the user is given the choice between several options. Altering users' perception and triggering according behavior is well rooted in research on priming from psychology and nudge theory from the field of economic behavior.

Thereby the success of a music recommender system, a system that proposes users what to explore or listen to next, depends on its ability to propose the right music, to the right user, at the right moment (i.e., in the right context). However, this task is extremely complex, as various factors influence a user’s music preferences. Amongst others, cultural aspects and characteristics (e.g., different requirements regarding diversity of a playlist or familiarity with its music tracks) have been shown to affect music perception, preferences, and listening behavior. Calling on this, the project entitled “Fine-grained culture-aware music recommender systems” investigates how music recommender systems could and should integrate cultural aspects in order to provide better recommendations. The research findings will answer the question how music recommender systems have to be designed to reflect cultural diversity and will provide insights into cross-cultural music perception, preferences, and listening behavior.\nSpecifically, the project will investigate the cultural requirements on music recommender systems – as concerns what listeners in different cultures expect with regard to the recommended music. Thereby, we postulate that different granularity levels of culture (e.g., individual, regional, national, or global level) have to be considered to improve music recommender systems. We hypothesize that the various cultural levels of different granularities have to be combined in a comprehensive way to transcend limitations of current music recommender systems. And we will investigate its impact on recommendation quality in cross-cultural studies with users from Austria, the United States, and Korea.\nOur scientific approach comprises four methodological orientations: (i) a combination of surveys and user panels, (ii) user modeling, (iii) designing and implementing prototypes of culture-aware music recommender systems, and (iv) cross-cultural studies with users to investigate their performance. The samples will include users from the United States, Austria, and Korea; we will focus on national culture, but also consider regional cultures (e.g., urban vs. suburban vs. countryside areas).\nIn contrast to past research in the field of culture-aware music information retrieval and recommendation, the project follows an approach that is driven by user needs and preferences. The project aims to design and implement music recommender systems that are able to meet those requirements by considering different granularity levels of cultural aspects in a comprehensive way.\n","date":1485907200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1485907200,"objectID":"4dfe5864de59bfd73963b99e5938006f","permalink":"https://christinebauer.eu/project/fwf579/","publishdate":"2017-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/fwf579/","section":"project","summary":"This FWF-funded project (2017--2020) aimed to design and implement music recommender systems that are able to meet those requirements by considering different granularity levels of cultural aspects in a comprehensive way.","tags":["music recommender systems","cultural aspects","personalization","context awareness"],"title":"Fine-grained culture-aware music recommender systems","type":"project"},{"authors":["Christine Bauer","Alexander Novotny"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628385076,"objectID":"ace9eba19085fba9850e7808d23369af","permalink":"https://christinebauer.eu/publications/bauer-2017-consolidatedview/","publishdate":"2021-08-08T01:13:50.916947Z","relpermalink":"/publications/bauer-2017-consolidatedview/","section":"publications","summary":"This paper’s main objective is to consolidate the knowledge on context in the realm of intelligent systems, systems that are aware of their context and can adapt their behavior accordingly.

In addition, we compare the context models with the context elements considered in the discourse on intelligent systems and find that the models do not properly represent the identified set of 3,741 unique context elements. As a result, we propose a consolidation of the findings from the 36 context models and the 3,741 unique context elements. The analysis reveals that there is a long tail of context categories that are considered only sporadically in context models.

Online social networks (e.g., Facebook) and other social media services would be nonexistent without having users disclosing personal information. However, for users it is not always favorable to provide personal information openly. The digital availability of personal information facilitates copying, transmitting, and integrating such information easily, and the exploitation of personal information could, thus, result in serious threats which can be both financial and social if in the wrong hands. Still, users' self-disclosing behavior is manipulable. In short, companies could use system design to either manipulate users to disclose less or more personal information. But what is the role of the company in this context? Is it morally okay to exploit users' personal information for their own profit? Or do companies have the responsibility to remunerate users whose personal information they exploit? Do companies have the responsibility to protect users from self-disclosing too much? There are two sides. One side supports that companies have to respect the users' desire for privacy and cannot collect and exploit at all their personal information for the companies' profit. The other side claims that if users give away their personal information abundantly and freely (e.g., on online social networks), why not use it; those that do not want to provide their personal information should not use the offered service. Total surveillance and full privacy are the two extreme poles, of course. Hybrid forms are possible and currently reality.

In times before the Internet era, the music business was characterized by a standardized process including the creation, selection, distribution, and consumption of music. The roles of the involved market players were clear-cut. Yet, in the early days of music business, the market was a highly concentrated market. However, with the evolution of Web 2.0 and its new possibilities for home recording available at relatively low-cost and easy to handle, a myriad of music items have been released on the Web. The main consequences of that development are the following: (1) the overall amount of music items available increased drastically, as there are now tens of millions of music items available at a consumer's fingertip; and (2) the ratio between (professional) high-quality music and low-quality music shifted towards an overall deterioration. This, in turn, has an impact on every market player involved in the music business.","tags":["artists","self-marketing","dark side","music ecosystem"],"title":"The dark side of Web 2.0: from self-marketing to self-destruction of music artists","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Schölgens","Sven Müller","Christine Bauer","Roman Tilly","Detlef Schoder"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1473724800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628385076,"objectID":"c4482aadf63cbcdc2500c50a8f03d6e6","permalink":"https://christinebauer.eu/publications/schoelgens-2016-aesthetics/","publishdate":"2021-08-08T01:13:51.329716Z","relpermalink":"/publications/schoelgens-2016-aesthetics/","section":"publications","summary":"Designing layouts that are perceived as pleasant by the viewer is no easy task: it requires a wide variety of skills, including a sense for aesthetics. When numerous documents with different content need to be created, one of the bottlenecks is to manually create appealing layouts for each document. Thus, automation for aesthetic layout creation is becoming increasingly important. Prerequisite for this automation are algorithms to measure aesthetics. While the literature proposes basic theoretical fundamentals and mathematical formulas as aesthetic measures, researchers have not operationalized these measures yet. This paper presents the challenges associated with and the lessons learned from operationalizing 36 aesthetics measures derived from the literature for the context of marketing brochures. We measured the aesthetics of 744 brochure pages from 10 major retailers and found very strong and highly significant correlations between at least 11 of the aesthetic measures, which represent five latent aesthetic concepts. Still, most of the measures were found to be independent in our sample, and they cover a wide range of different aesthetic concepts. Nevertheless, our results suggest that retailers optimize some of these measures more than others. In terms of the aesthetic measures, retailers seem to design brochure pages in the same way regardless of which category products on this page belong to or if it is the first, last, an odd, or an even page. We propose to consider the quality values of aesthetic measures derived from our analysis of the measured brochures as target values for automated document layout creation for aesthetic marketing brochures.","tags":[],"title":"Aesthetic measures for document layouts: operationalization and analysis in the context of marketing brochures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christine Bauer","Michael Schiffinger"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1464739200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628385077,"objectID":"d004621919fcce04cc7ea10be53cb390","permalink":"https://christinebauer.eu/publications/bauer-2016-perceivedrisks/","publishdate":"2021-08-08T01:13:52.158543Z","relpermalink":"/publications/bauer-2016-perceivedrisks/","section":"publications","summary":"Disclosing personal information to a crowd, with all its risks and benefits, is almost ubiquitous in Web 2.0.

Empirically, our study relies on a (statistical) meta-analysis of 38 studies. Our findings support the assumptions regarding the effect of privacy calculus on OSD: benefits and trust beliefs increase OSD, privacy concerns and risk beliefs reduce it. Furthermore, the positive effect of the former PC aspects on OSD is larger than the negative effect of the latter. The effects of benefits and risk beliefs on OSD are moderated by cultural differences, unlike those of privacy concerns and trust beliefs. Uncertainty avoidance and indulgence reduce the positive effect of benefits on OSD, masculinity and power distance enhance it. The negative effect of risk beliefs is reduced by uncertainty avoidance and long-term orientation, but aggravated by indulgence. In addition to advocating increased cultural awareness for online service providers, our findings support PC as a useful concept in OSD research, but suggest that the most prominent cultural dimensions might not be the most relevant ones in intercultural OSD research.","tags":["online self-disclosure","privacy","meta-analysis","meta-regression","cultural differences","culture","privacy calculus"],"title":"Perceived risks and benefits of online self-disclosure: affected by culture?

Various types and implementations of crowdsourcing have emerged in the market; many of them are related to logistics. While we can identify plenty of crowd logistics applications using information technology capabilities and information sharing in practice, theories behind this phenomenon have received only limited attention. This paper accounts for filling this research gap by analyzing the crowd’s contributions in logistics of goods and information. Design/methodology/approach – This paper is part of an ongoing research endeavor in the field of location-based crowdsourcing. It represents conceptual work that builds on a literature review enriched with an in-depth analysis of real-world examples in the field of crowd logistics. Using a scoring method, we provide an example how a company may evaluate the alternatives of crowd logistics. The main approach is an analysis of variants of how the social crowd may be integrated in logistics processes. The work is conceptual in its core. Thereby, we use real-world examples of crowdsourcing applications to underpin the evaluated variants of crowd logistics.\n\nFindings – The paper presents relevant theoretical background on crowd logistics. The authors differentiate between variants of crowd logistics with their flow of materials, goods and information. Thereby they zoom in the type, significance and process flow of the crowd’s contributions. They discuss potential advantages and challenges of logistics with the performing crowd and deeply discuss opportunities and challenges from a business and from an individual’s perspective. Finally, they highlight a route map for future research directions in this novel interdisciplinary research field. Research limitations/implications – As this work is conceptual in its core, generalizations may be drawn only with great care. Still, we are in a position to propose a route map for further research in this area in this paper. Also the integration of an analysis of a scale of real-world applications allows us to highlight our research’s practical relevance and implications.\n\nOriginality/value – The main contribution of this paper is an in-depth analysis and consolidation of innovative crowd logistics applications to provide an overview on recent implementations. The authors propose a categorization scheme and contribute with a route map for further research in the field of crowd logistics.","tags":[],"title":"'Crowd logistics': the contribution of social crowds in logistics activities","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christine Bauer","Anind K.

As such systems have a number of properties, which distinguish them from traditional systems, their design requires a new approach to requirements engineering and to product development. While existing contributions concentrate on individual aspects in the design process, there is a lack of a holistic perspective on the design of intelligent systems. Considering the entire design process, would allow for the creation of better functioning designs, as has been demonstrated in various fields of system design. Furthermore, little is known about how people design intelligent systems. A deep understanding about design practices is, though, a prerequisite for coming up with systematic improvements. The contribution of this paper is twofold: First, based on interviews, we analyze the design processes undertaken by designers, and present five underlying process archetypes. We focus on how designers identify, select, and consider context across the entire design process. Second, we propose an improved design process for intelligent systems that aims at supporting system designers in their design task in order to serve an organization’s, and/or users’ needs.","tags":["system design","context awareness","intelligent system","design process","context selection","context identification","context adaptivity"],"title":"Considering context in the design of intelligent systems: current practices and suggestions for improvement","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christine Bauer","Christine Strauss"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628385077,"objectID":"8ff92ca395bb4b21847568a82f40685f","permalink":"https://christinebauer.eu/publications/bauer-2016-locationbased/","publishdate":"2021-08-08T01:13:52.020568Z","relpermalink":"/publications/bauer-2016-locationbased/","section":"publications","summary":"Location-based advertising (LBA) allows the delivery of advertising messages to consumers in places that are known for their particular high and positive advertising effect.

Accordingly, within the mobile marketing domain, LBA on mobile devices turns over a new leaf. This young research field is interdisciplinary at its core and marketing and technical experts expect major impetus. To contribute to this growing field, we systematically analyze and evaluate existing literature in the field of LBA on mobile devices, and present the results of six analyses.

Furthermore, we pinpoint selected “white spots” in research and draw attention to promising areas for future research and directions of future development trends.","tags":["systematic literature review","location-based systems","location-based advertising","location-based marketing","mobile advertising","advertising","context adaptivity","targeted advertising"],"title":"Location-based advertising on mobile devices: a literature review and analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andreas Mladenow","Christine Bauer","Christine Strauss"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628385077,"objectID":"6848584aaee17f301594f36551f19c2a","permalink":"https://christinebauer.eu/publications/mladenow-2016-power/","publishdate":"2021-08-08T01:13:51.604771Z","relpermalink":"/publications/mladenow-2016-power/","section":"publications","summary":"Information and communication technologies (ICT) are enablers for cooperative and collective online shopping. This novel phenomenon is also known under the terms “group buying” and “collective buying” and can be found in business-to-business (B2B) contexts as well as in business-to-consumer (B2C) shopping transactions. We investigate recent developments regarding enablers and inhibitors of ICT-based group buying concepts in various markets. In this paper, we perform a thorough analysis of group buying approaches with the intent to explain the evolution, developments, and changes of online group shopping variants. We provide an overview of approaches and derived variants of the online group buying concept highlighted with selected real-world application examples. A detailed SWOT analysis (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) for each of the two dominant approaches (top-down and bottom-up) represents the core contribution of the paper and may build the basis for the development and improvement of future business models in the field.","tags":[],"title":"Power to the (shopping) people!

It was developed by the Object Management Group with support of the major organizations in the fields of software engineering and information systems. Despite its wide use, when it comes to repre- senting ubiquitous business processes, this business process modeling language is lacking. Objective: To address BPMN’s deficiency in representing ubiquitous business processes, we extend it and present uBPMN (or ubiquitous BPMN).\n\nMethod: First, we analyze the modeling requirements for representing ubiquitous business processes. Based on the requirements, we conservatively extend the Meta-Object Facility meta-model and the XML Schema Definition of BPMN as well as extend the notation. The extension, that we call uBPMN follows the same outline as set by the Object Management Group for BPMN.\n\nResults: The proposed uBPMN not only allows for modeling ubiquitous business processes but also lays the groundwork for potentially deploying a variety of ubiquitous computing technologies. We illustrate all of uBPMN’s capabilities and benefits with real-life examples.\n\nConclusion: uBPMN extends BPMN v2.0 with new capabilities to deal with ubiquitous computing technologies.","tags":["uBPMN","ubiquitous business processes","business process modeling"],"title":"uBPMN: A BPMN extension for modeling ubiquitous business processes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christine Bauer","Simone Kriglstein"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1449792e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628385078,"objectID":"e807c967933c11a9f39d3628c6f5441c","permalink":"https://christinebauer.eu/publications/bauer-2015-runningtracking/","publishdate":"2021-08-08T01:13:53.403072Z","relpermalink":"/publications/bauer-2015-runningtracking/","section":"publications","summary":"In the last years, a large number of sport and fitness applications for smartphones were developed for supporting a healthy lifestyle by not only encouraging people to follow a balanced diet but also to motivate them to engage in physical activities.

As artists are typically self-dependent in managing their business, they should have managerial skills besides those skills necessary to perform their artistic core activities. If the lack of managerial skills is a reason why artists fail to make a living from their talent, then this chain of cause and effect could be ruptured by adequate educational opportunities. This paper analyses the curricula of a wide range of institutions offering art education programmes and identifies their managerial learning content. In doing so, we focused on German-speaking countries, the so-called DACH region (i.e. Germany, Austria and Switzerland, whereas D, A and CH are country codes). We identified and analysed 159 course syllabi of 81 art universities, schools and academies. The results of our study indicate a lack of managerial learning contents: a vast majority of institutions follow a rather traditional approach to art education, focusing solely on artistic competences. We suggest the implementation of managerial learning contents to better prepare art students for successful careers in the arts.","tags":["management skills","artists","arts","curricula","education","DACH countries","DACH region"],"title":"Educating artists in management: an analysis of art education programmes in DACH region","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Natalia Kryvinska","Christine Bauer","Christine Strauss","Michal Gregus"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1409702400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628385079,"objectID":"76d3ac4273963a51fa250a5462390fa6","permalink":"https://christinebauer.eu/publications/kryvinska-2014-swot/","publishdate":"2021-08-08T01:13:53.95465Z","relpermalink":"/publications/kryvinska-2014-swot/","section":"publications","summary":"Due to their technological complexity, traditional software development paradigms are not appropriate to face the challenges in the modern Web 2.0 world.

This article introduces an evaluation scheme that includes nine categories of performance measurement. Applying the scheme to Facebook’s use by social organisations in Vienna, we demonstrate the scheme’s applicability. Plus, by using various indicators and benchmarks, we evaluate the level of sophistication of each organization’s use of Facebook. We investigated all 517 social organizations based in Vienna, including those in all fields of practice, based on publicly available Facebook data from January to June 2012.

We hope that our approach contributes to a better understanding of ‘machine to user’ adaption, and to mobile sports applications in particular.","tags":["reactive music","jogging","running","context-adaptivity","music controllability"],"title":"Reactive music: when user behavior affects sounds in real-time","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peter Lasinger","Christine Bauer"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1363132800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628385080,"objectID":"f5381512a842026cb9ef2fa66421f434","permalink":"https://christinebauer.eu/publications/lasinger-2013-situationalization-persit/","publishdate":"2021-08-08T01:13:54.922192Z","relpermalink":"/publications/lasinger-2013-situationalization-persit/","section":"publications","summary":"‘Digital out-of-home advertising’ (DOOHA) leverages digital screens to reach out to consumers at any time and anywhere in public space.

This paper compares 13 meta-models with respect to their scope. Taking an empirical approach, we matched the meta-models against context variables used in research practice. On the one hand, the meta-models find themselves well reflected by research practice, in a sense that the models’ context categories can be described by context variables reported in research. On the other hand, the results clearly indicate that each of the 13 context meta-models fails to describe the full landscape of context. Many context variables used in reported research are not covered by any of the analysed context meta-models.

In an online survey-based experiment we have asked 1.045 Facebook users how much they would be willing to pay for keeping their personal information. Surprisingly, 48.1 percent of participants are not willing to pay a single Euro, – thus, valuing their information at zero. Results indicate that people that show ‘spamming’ behaviour and users that use Facebook for ‘diary keeping’ are significantly more willing to pay a certain amount higher than zero to be able to keep their personal Facebook information. Interestingly, having analysed various kinds of user behaviour, the regression model still explains no more than 14.2 percent of variance. Additionally, this article discusses four different method manipulations for eliciting people’s willingness to pay for personal information and provides methodical guidance for future research in the field.","tags":["Facebook","value of information","privacy","willingness to pay","personal information","pricing"],"title":"On the value of information: what Facebook users are willing to pay","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Christine Bauer (2012).

Still, it is a rather novel research field. First empirical studies focused on consumer behavior. At the backend, though, digital signage brings together various market players, all of which with their very own business objectives and expected benefits, where some of which may complement one another and some might be conflicting. In order to tap the full potential of digital signage, the entire range of market players need to be provided with appropriate backend services. In emerging, technology-driven applications such as digital signage there is a vital need for a universally valid, flexible, structuring framework that provides the basis for target-oriented research using a shared conceptualization. In fact, such a framework is essential to enable, yield and foster sustainability in a novel and interdisciplinary research field like digital signage. For this reason, we introduce a cohesive and flexible conceptual framework for contextual digital signage that integrates the entire set of possible market players in their relevant roles, application location categories, strategies and contextualization types of a contextual digital signage system.","tags":["digital signage","pervasive advertising","context adaptivity","context awareness","framework"],"title":"A conceptual framework for backend services of contextual digital signage","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christine Bauer"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1325376e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628385081,"objectID":"f5f87391a2f3ff7bc0f06cbfa0683a93","permalink":"https://christinebauer.eu/publications/bauer-2012-bands/","publishdate":"2021-08-08T01:13:56.029627Z","relpermalink":"/publications/bauer-2012-bands/","section":"publications","summary":"Managing a big band is a challenge, similar to managing a small or medium- sized enterprise. A type of band particularly difficult to manage is a telephone band that does not have a fixed line-up of musicians. Together, the musicians form a virtual organisation with the bandleader as a focal company. Every participant in the organisation brings in a certain set of skills, has specific business goals, and has to bear some risks. The focal company has to assume full contractual liability to the event organiser. However, bandleaders managing these organisational constructs typically have an artistic background rather than a managerial one. To date, the processes involved in managing bands have not been analysed. It is nearly impossible to improve these processes because processes are not clear. In a competitive environment, members do not seek to share knowledge on processes with their competitors because knowledge on processes is a business asset. However, as virtual organisations, musicians and bandleaders are mutually dependent. Accordingly, knowledge sharing forms the basis for pro- cess improvements, which can only be achieved by joint efforts. Accordingly, this work delivers results in the following areas. First, this investigation targets the activities involved in managing a medium-sized telephone band, made transparent by modelling the processes.

Based on the person-centred approach to learning, a set of non- directive, promotive activities that foster significant learning have been identified and extensively researched in classroom settings. Equally, it turned out that technology-enhanced learning settings, which thoughtfully combine online elements with learning in presence phases, have benefits compared to pure e-learning or traditional learning settings in class. For instance, a combination allows creating or making use of distinct settings according to requirements of, for example, different learning phases, activities, or styles, etc. that are most likely distinct as also the results of this work show. Adopting the well-proven promotive activities to technology-enhanced learning environments is, though, challenging as transferring these activities to technology-enhanced settings requires appropriate media selection, adequate adaptation of activity patterns to a chosen setting, and -- above all -- respective media competence that allows for conveying the underlying interpersonal qualities with the respective medium. Nevertheless, as this work demonstrates, the person-centred approach with the three levels of learning and personal growth (intellect, social skills, and personality) and technology-enhanced learning complement one another and are, thus, a particularly effective combination. The major scientific goal of this work is to investigate whether and how non-directive, promotive activities may be applied in cooperative technology-enhanced learning settings. Besides transferring existing activity patterns to the online context, this work presents -- by giving practical examples -- new opportunities that could only emerge with technology enhancement. With respect to promotive activities, the main three fields of interest are: motivational aspects, the impact of media selection on peer review, and active listening with means of written online communication. By combining qualitative and quantitative methods, these aspects have been investigated in a scale of studies conducted in five distinct courses at the University of Vienna. Four distinct courses, which implement similar but, though, different course designs, were compared with the aim to identify pedagogical elements that drive motivation. As expected, students appreciate the person-centred style. Furthermore, rewarding self-initiative and high practical relevance are qualified motivation drivers. Investigating the impact of media selection, two case studies compared online and face-to-face peer reviews. With respect to cooperative learn- ing, the studies explored communication and collaboration aspects. Furthermore the quality and kind of feedback were analysed. Essentially, the setting with written online peer review and the possibility to raise a query seemed highly appropriate. Adopting the highly recognised face-to-face communication concept of active listening in settings with written online communication is a novel asset that had been explored in two case studies. Demanding both verbal and nonverbal skills, this way of communication improves mutual understanding by using techniques like paraphrasing. For instance, it avoids misunderstandings and in conflicts people tend to be more willing to explain in detail, which increases chances to find a joint solution. The presented studies investigate active listening in an educational setting using written online communication. Thereby, the focus laid on instant messaging and e-mail communication, examining both settings' capacities and differences and exploring whether active listening is effective in written online communication. Besides demonstrating that active listen- ing is not limited to an oral setting, these studies aimed at investigating students' media competence. Interestingly enough, students' report scepticism although analysis of their communicative behaviour provides evidence that students are able to overcome the difficulties of the respectively used media (instant messaging and e-mail) and can, hence, apply the concept accordingly. While, naturally, there are limitations to expressing empathy in online settings, the latter were found to offer valuable opportunities that face-to-face conversations tend to lack. For instance, it appears that instant messaging tools leave control with the person who expresses his or her thought. This allows this person to completely verbalise his or her thought before responding. Analysis re- veals that the benefits can already be observed with newcomers to the concept. Finally, the work draws up general recommendations concerning promotive activities in technology-enhanced learning settings in higher education targeted at students of business informatics and computer science.

This article explores whether the highly recognized face-to-face communication concept “active listening” can also be applied to online settings. Demanding verbal and nonverbal skills, this way of communication improves mutual understanding by using techniques like paraphrasing. For instance, it avoids misunderstandings and in conflicts it increases chances to find a joint solution. The presented study investigates whether “active listening” is effective in written online communication, which is a novel asset. Focusing on instant messaging and e-mail, we examined both settings’ capacities and differences. Qualitative analysis based on a unique data set including log files and written user reactions on online “active listening” activities, reveals that “active listening” is possible in online communication, although a face-to -face setting is preferred due to a number of constraints imposed by online media. Results show that, while there are limitations to expressing empathy in online settings, the latter offer valuable opportunities that face-to-face conversations tend to lack. For instance, it appears that online media leave control with a communicator by allowing to completely verbalize thoughts before responding. Our results provide preliminary support that even newcomers to the concept can benefit from using active listening techniques in their online communication.","tags":["technology-enhanced learning","active listening","person-centered learning"],"title":"Introducing \"active listening\" to instant messaging and e-mail: benefits and limitations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christine Bauer"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1230768e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628385083,"objectID":"2cdb02f1278ac36c92a27e280c68d366","permalink":"https://christinebauer.eu/publications/bauer-2009-promotive-diss/","publishdate":"2021-08-08T01:13:58.248328Z","relpermalink":"/publications/bauer-2009-promotive-diss/","section":"publications","summary":"Numerous studies indicate that learning is most effective in terms of persistency when it addresses the whole person rather than merely the intellect. Based on the person-centred approach to learning, a set of non-directive, promotive activities that foster significant learning have been identified and extensively researched in classroom settings. Equally, it turned out that technology-enhanced learning settings, which thoughtfully combine online elements with learning in presence phases, have benefits compared to pure e-learning or traditional learning settings in class. For instance, a combination allows creating or making use of distinct settings according to requirements of, for example, different learning phases, activities, or styles, etc. that are most likely distinct as also the results of this work show. Adopting the well-proven promotive activities to technology-enhanced learning environments is, though, challenging as transferring these activities to technologyenhanced settings requires appropriate media selection, adequate adaptation of activity patterns to a chosen setting, and - above all - respective media competence that allows for conveying the underlying interpersonal qualities with the respective medium. Nevertheless, as this dissertation demonstrates, the person-centred approach with the three levels of learning and personal growth (intellect, social skills, and personality) and technology-enhanced learning complement one another and are, thus, a particularly effective combination. The major scientific goal of this dissertation is to investigate whether and how nondirective, promotive activities may be applied in cooperative technology-enhanced learning settings. Besides transferring existing activity patterns to the online context, this work presents - by giving practical examples - new opportunities that could only emerge with technology enhancement. With respect to promotive activities, the main three fields of interest are: motivational aspects, the impact of media selection on peer review, and active listening with means of written online communication. By combining qualitative and quantitative methods, these aspects have been investigated in a scale of studies conducted in five distinct courses at the University of Vienna. Four distinct courses, which implement similar but, though, different course designs, were compared with the aim to identify pedagogical elements that drive motivation. As expected, students appreciate the person-centred style. Furthermore, rewarding selfinitiative and high practical relevance are qualified motivation drivers. Investigating the impact of media selection, two case studies compared online and facetoface peer reviews. With respect to cooperative learning, the studies explored communication and collaboration aspects. Furthermore the quality and kind of feedback were analysed. Essentially, the setting with written online peer review and the possibility to raise a query seemed highly appropriate. Adopting the highly recognised face-to-face communication concept of active listening in settings with written online communication is a novel asset that had been explored in two case studies. Demanding both verbal and nonverbal skills, this way of communication improves mutual understanding by using techniques like paraphrasing. For instance, it avoids misunderstandings and in conflicts people tend to be more willing to explain in detail, which increases chances to find a joint solution. The presented studies investigate active listening in an educational setting using written online communication. Thereby, the focus laid on instant messaging and e-mail communication, examining both settings' capacities and differences and exploring whether active listening is effective in written online communication. Besides demonstrating that active listening is not limited to an oral setting, these studies aimed at investigating students' media competence. Interestingly enough, students' report scepticism although analysis of their communicative behaviour provides evidence that students are able to overcome the difficulties of the respectively used media (instant messaging and e-mail) and can, hence, apply the concept accordingly. While, naturally, there are limitations to expressing empathy in online settings, the latter were found to offer valuable opportunities that face-to-face conversations tend to lack. For instance, it appears that instant messaging tools leave control with the person who expresses his or her thought. This allows this person to completely verbalise his or her thought before responding. Analysis reveals that the benefits can already be observed with newcomers to the concept. Finally, the dissertation draws up general recommendations concerning promotive activities in technology-enhanced learning settings in higher education targeted at students of business informatics and computer science. Findings do not only give direction to educators but do, moreover, provide indication for tool designers, what they need to take into consideration when developing tools that support whole person learning.","tags":["technology-enhanced learning","cooperative learning","promotive activities","person-centered learning","peer review","active listening","motivation"],"title":"Promotive activities in technology-enhanced cooperative whole person learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christine Bauer","Kathrin Figl"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1224633600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628385084,"objectID":"3a7502163f540d278ffbb3d2421aa6e8","permalink":"https://christinebauer.eu/publications/bauer-2008-active-listening/","publishdate":"2021-08-08T01:13:58.65874Z","relpermalink":"/publications/bauer-2008-active-listening/","section":"publications","summary":"'Active listening' is a well-known ingredient in contexts that involve gathering information and solving problems.

The results of this evaluation encourage the further integration of CBTs within teaching.","tags":[],"title":"Computer-Based Trainings in action: a product oriented evaluation of the CBT Hyperbook Privatrecht and the examination of factors influencing the use of CBTs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christine Bauer"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1009843200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628385085,"objectID":"1a2acf51201bf65a1df897a90856624a","permalink":"https://christinebauer.eu/publications/bauer-2002-kommunikation/","publishdate":"2021-08-08T01:13:59.75655Z","relpermalink":"/publications/bauer-2002-kommunikation/","section":"publications","summary":"Die Globalisierung, die Innovationsdynamik und die Potenziale der Informations- und Kommunikationstechnologien haben neue Rahmenbedingungen geschaffen, die es erlauben, Raum und Zeit zu überwinden. Dadurch ist eine neue Form der Kleingruppe möglich geworden – das virtuelle Team. Das Ziel dieser Arbeit ist es, zu untersuchen, welche Kommunikationssysteme zur Unterstützung von Kommunikationsprozessen in virtuellen Teams geeignet sind. Dabei werden zuerst Anforderungen an Systeme definiert, die sich aus dem spezifischen Kontext, in dem virtuelle Teams arbeiten, ergeben. Anschließend werden verschiedene Kommunikationsarten anhand dieser Anforderungen beurteilt und schlussendlich die Effizienz verschiedenen Kommunikationssysteme (die eben ganz bestimmte Kommunikationsarten unterstützen) bezüglich Ihrer Unterstützungsfunktion für virtuelle Teams bewertet. Zu Beginn beschäftigt sich die Arbeit mit den Grundlagen von virtuellen Teams einerseits und mit Kommunikation andererseits. Danach werden die besonderen Anforderungen an Kommunikationssysteme, die sich aus der spezifischen Situation von virtuellen Teams ergeben (das sind im Wesentlichen reduzierter physischer, sozialer und zeitlicher Kontext von Interaktionen), abgeleitet. Dabei wird zwischen allgemeinen, aufgabenbezogenen und sozialbezogenen Anforderungen unterschieden. Dieser umfassende Beurteilungskatalog für Kommunikationssysteme zieht unterschiedliche Betrachtungsweisen und Resultate aus verschiedensten Forschungsrichtungen ein. In der Arbeit werden überdies Umfeldfaktoren, die neben Kommunikationssystemen ebenfalls die Effizienz von Kommunikation beeinflussen können, in der Arbeit behandelt. Hierbei wird auf den Grad der Anonymität, die Vermittlung von physischem Kontext, die Erfahrung mit Kommunikationssystemen bzw. die Akzeptanz dieser Technologien eingegangen. In einem weiteren Abschnitt werden die verschieden Arten von Kommunikation diskutiert. Hier wird zwischen synchroner und asynchroner, zwischen mündlicher und schriftlicher sowie zwischen Face-to-Face- und computervermittelter Kommunikation unterschieden. Zur Beurteilung der Kommunikationsarten werden die zuvor erarbeiteten Kriterien herangezogen. Die Beurteilung wird mit Literatur aus verschiedensten Forschungsrichtungen untermauert. Schlussendlich werden die Vor- und Nachteile einzelner Kommunikationssysteme (Face-to-Face, E-mail, Videokonferenz, Realtime Chat) für virtuelle Teams beurteilt, wobei auch der Einfluss von Umfeldfaktoren in der Diskussion berücksichtigt wird. Die Beurteilung orientiert sich and der zuvor entwickelten Struktur (Bewertungsmatrix). Die Arbeit schließt mit der provokanten, aber durch die vorhergehenden Überlegungen gut begründete These, dass Face-to-Face-Situationen nicht unbedingt die optimale Voraussetzung für effiziente Kommunikation darstellt und dass virtuelle Teams in Kommunikationsprozessen durch den Einsatz von spezifischen Kommunikationssystemen die Effizienz konventioneller Teams übertreffen können.","tags":["communication","virtual teams"],"title":"Kommunikation in virtuellen Teams","type":"publication"}]
